A keyboard-driven, cross-platform programmer's text editor built with **JDK 25**,
**JavaFX 26**, [**RichTextFX**](https://github.com/FXMisc/RichTextFX) and **Maven**. Every action is a registered command, reachable by an
Emacs-style keymap or a fuzzy command palette.

Editora is built with the help of AI coding tools.

## Features

- **Command-driven core** — every action is a `Command`; bind it to a chord or run it
  from the M-x command palette, which shows each command's one-line description and opens its online
  docs with `C-h`.
- **Keyboard "Jump to…" popups** — fuzzy pickers for recent files (`C-x C-r`), the active file's
  structure/symbols (`M-g i`), open files/tabs (`C-x b`), and tool windows (`M-g t`) — keyboard-first
  alternatives to their list/tool-window UIs.
- **Keyboard file finder** (`C-x C-f`) — Emacs `find-file`-style path popup with prefix
  autocomplete; type/`Tab` to complete, Enter to descend folders or open (or create) a file. The
  Open toolbar icon still uses the native OS dialog.
- **Projects** (off by default; enable in Settings) — VSCode single-folder-workspace style: a root
  folder + its own saved session (open files, layout, folds), shown as a filterable file tree in the
  Project tool window with a project switcher in the toolbar. Open (`C-x C-p`)/switch (`C-x p`)/close
  via the palette or toolbar; switching restores that project's files and layout. With no project open, the
  Project tool window becomes a **"Current Folder"** explorer rooted at the active file's directory, tracking
  the focused tab.
- **Keybinding themes** — choose **Emacs** (default), **CUA**, **Sublime Text**, **VSCode**, or
  **IntelliJ IDEA** in Settings → Keymaps (or the `Keymap: Select…` command); switching is live, no
  restart, and each theme adapts to macOS (Cmd) vs Windows/Linux (Ctrl). Emacs uses multi-key chord
  sequences (e.g. `C-x C-s`). (Modal Vim is on the roadmap.)
- **Configurable shortcuts** — Settings → Keymaps lists every command with its current chord; **record**
  a new shortcut (multi-key sequences supported), **reset** one to the keymap default, or reset them all.
  Rebinding warns on conflicts and applies live; overrides persist and layer on top of the active theme.
  (On macOS, the Option dead keys `Option`+`e`/`i`/`u`/`n`/`` ` `` are intercepted by the OS for
  accent composition, so a few `M-`-chords like `M-e` aren't reachable by keyboard there — the
  command palette still works.)
- **Syntax highlighting** — TextMate grammars (via [tm4e](https://github.com/eclipse/tm4e)) for 40+
  languages and formats: Java, TypeScript/JavaScript, XML, shell, PowerShell, DOS batch, Python,
  Groovy, Kotlin, Ruby, PHP, C, C++, Rust, Go, C#, Lua, Markdown, JSON, CSS, HTML, YAML, INI, TOML,
  SQL, Dockerfile, Terraform/HCL, Mermaid, `.http`, unified diffs (`.diff`/`.patch` — added/removed
  lines tint green/red), Makefile, justfile, Protocol Buffers (`.proto`), GraphQL, Java
  `.properties`, `.gitignore`/`.gitattributes`, dotenv, and common Linux/tool config files
  (systemd units, SSH/Git config, crontab, hosts, fstab, …).
- **Bundled fonts** — JetBrains Mono (default), Cascadia Code, Fira Code, IBM Plex Mono,
  and Source Code Pro ship with the app; no system install required.
- **Editor view options** — 80-column ruler and current-line highlight.
- **Auto / smart indentation** — Enter keeps the indentation and adds a level after a block opener
  (per language: braces, `:` for Python/YAML, `do`/`then` for shell, `def`/`class`/`do` for Ruby, open
  tags for XML/HTML); Enter between a matching pair opens an indented stanza; typing a closing
  bracket/keyword re-aligns the line. Indent unit (tab vs spaces) is inferred per file, or forced
  globally via Settings → Editor → "Indent style" (Detect / Spaces / Tabs).
- **Snippets** — VS Code/TextMate snippets with tab stops, placeholders, choices, and variables; manage your own per-language snippets in **Settings → Snippets** (or `Snippets: Manage Snippets…`), saved under `<configDir>/snippets/`.
- **File templates** — "New File From Template" scaffolds; manage them in **Settings → Templates** (or `Templates: Manage File Templates…`) — the shipped templates are shown read-only and editing one saves a personal override under `<configDir>/templates/`.
- **EditorConfig** — honors a project's `.editorconfig` (nearest-directory-wins, walking up to `root`):
  indent style/size and `tab_width`, `end_of_line`, `charset` (utf-8, utf-8-bom, latin1, utf-16le/be —
  round-tripped on read and save), `max_line_length` (drives the column ruler), and on-save
  `trim_trailing_whitespace` / `insert_final_newline`. On by default; toggle via Settings → Editor or the
  "View: Toggle EditorConfig" palette command.
- **Server log viewer** — `.log` files get severity highlighting (ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG/TRACE, both inline
  and as a left-edge bar that works even on huge logs), a floating **Follow** toggle (`tail -f` — streams new
  lines as the file grows and auto-scrolls), **open-the-tail** for very large logs (opens read-only at the
  end), and **live level + regex filtering** (filter as you type by a level floor and a regex — or a literal
  substring when it isn't valid regex; a stack trace inherits its record's level so it stays visible).
  Detects Logback/Log4j, `java.util.logging`, syslog, nginx, structured/JSON, zerolog, and access logs. Logs
  open in **View mode** (read-only with an "Enable Editing" banner) by default — follow still streams while
  read-only. On by default (Settings → Editor → Logs, "View: Toggle Log Viewer"); `Log: Toggle Follow` / `Filter by Level` /
  `Filter by Pattern` / `Clear Filter` / `View as Log` in the palette.
- **Word/line-level undo** — undo/redo breaks at word, whitespace, and newline boundaries (and after a typing pause), so one undo removes a word or line rather than a whole typing burst.
- **Undo History** — an *Undo History* tool window (`M-g u`) lists in-session document checkpoints; double-click or Enter jumps back to any recent state.
- **Auto Close Tags** — typing the `>` of an HTML/XML open tag inserts the matching closing tag and
  leaves the caret between them; void elements, self-closing tags, comments/doctypes, and `>` inside
  attribute strings are left alone. On by default (Settings → Editor; "Toggle Auto Close Tags").
- **Auto Rename Tag** — editing an HTML/XML tag name renames the paired open/close tag as you type
  (VS Code behavior); comments, CDATA, quoted attributes, void elements, and `<script>`/`<style>`
  content are skipped, and a brand-new tag never renames an unrelated one. On by default
  (Settings → Editor; "Toggle Auto Rename Tag" in the palette).
- **Auto-close & matching brackets** — typing `([{`/quotes inserts the matching closer (type over it to
  skip, wrap a selection by typing a bracket/quote around it, Backspace clears an empty pair); the
  bracket matching the one next to the caret is highlighted.
- **Comment / uncomment** (`M-;`) — toggles a line comment for a single line and a block/region comment
  for a multi-line selection, using the language's comment syntax (`//`, `#`, `<!-- -->`, `/* */`, `--`, …).
- **Fill paragraph** (`M-q`) — re-wrap a paragraph (or the selection, with "Fill Region") to a fill column
  (`C-x f`, default 70), preserving its indentation and an adaptive fill prefix — line comments, Markdown
  blockquotes (`>`), and Javadoc (`*`) — so code comments and quoted text wrap correctly.
- **Emacs editing & movement commands** — the full set beyond the basics: backward-kill-word (`M-DEL`),
  word/region case conversion (`M-u`/`M-l`/`M-c`, `C-x C-u`/`C-x C-l`), join-line (`M-^`), whitespace
  fixups (`M-\`, `M-SPC`), delete-blank-lines (`C-x C-o`), open-line (`C-o`), kill-whole-line (`C-S-DEL`),
  zap-to-char (`M-z`), balanced-expression motion (`C-M-f`/`C-M-b`, mark/kill-sexp), defun motion
  (`C-M-a`/`C-M-e`), and mark-paragraph / mark-whole-buffer. All palette-discoverable and rebindable.
- **Mark ring** — `C-SPC` records the caret on a per-buffer ring; `C-x C-SPC` pops back to the most recent
  mark and cycles through older ones on repeat. Marks track their text through edits. Distinct from the
  automatic jump-history (`nav.back`/`nav.forward`).
- **Query-replace** (`M-%`, `C-M-%` for regexp) — Emacs replace-with-confirmation: stop on each match and
  press `y`/`n`/`!`/`.`/`q` to replace, skip, do-all-the-rest, replace-and-stop, or quit. Regexp mode
  expands `$1` group references. (In the Emacs keymap, `M-%` runs this rather than the find bar's replace.)
- **Narrowing** (`C-x n …`) — restrict the buffer to the selection (`C-x n n`), the enclosing function
  (`C-x n d`) or the fold block at the caret (`C-x n f`), and widen with `C-x n w`. Genuinely restricts the
  buffer rather than just hiding lines, so search, replace and Select All see only the region. A status-bar
  badge shows the state; saving still writes the whole file.
- **Rectangles** (`C-x r …`) — the Emacs column-oriented commands: kill/copy/yank a rectangle, delete it,
  clear it to spaces, open it (shifting text right), replace each line's segment with a string, or number
  the lines down its left edge. Point and mark define the corners, so a zero-width rectangle is the classic
  way to prefix a block of lines. Each is a single undo step. Distinct from Alt+drag column selection, which
  gives you independent cursors instead.
- **Kill ring** — every kill command feeds a 120-entry ring rather than just deleting: `C-y` yanks the most
  recent, **`M-y`** (yank-pop) steps back through older entries, and *Edit: Yank from Kill Ring…* picks from
  it directly. Consecutive kills accumulate into one entry (`C-k C-k C-k` then `C-y` restores all three
  lines; `M-DEL M-DEL` gives the words back in reading order). Kills also go to the system clipboard, and
  text copied in another application takes precedence over the ring, so yanking is never stale.
- **String manipulation** — case-style conversions on the selection or the identifier at the caret
  (camelCase / PascalCase / snake_case / SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE / kebab-case / dot.case, a *Cycle Case Style*
  that steps a token through the styles on repeated presses, swap case) plus whole-line transforms on the
  selection or whole file (sort ascending/descending — numeric-aware and case-insensitive — sort by length,
  reverse, shuffle, remove duplicate/empty lines, trim trailing whitespace). All individual palette commands,
  or one filterable picker: "Edit: String Manipulation…" (`C-c x`).
- **Multiple cursors & column selection** — VS Code–style multi-caret editing: add a caret at the next
  occurrence of the selection / above / below, type or edit everywhere at once, `Esc` to collapse; plus
  Alt-drag column/box selection. (Powered by a personal RichTextFX fork.)
- **Copy/cut the current line with no selection** — VS Code's `editor.emptySelectionClipboard`: with
  nothing selected, Copy grabs the whole current line and Cut removes it (one undoable step). On by default;
  toggle in Settings → Editor or via "View: Toggle Copy Line When No Selection".
- **Spell checking** — red wavy underlines on misspelled words, with right-click suggestions,
  Add-to-Dictionary, and Ignore. Source files only check comments and string literals; plaintext and
  Markdown are checked in full. Toggle via "View: Toggle Spell Check"; choose a dictionary per file
  ("Spell Check: Set Language…", ships English en_US/en_GB, Spanish for Spain and Mexico, and French). A bundled
  **technical-terms dictionary** (`config`, `async`, `middleware`, `kubernetes`, …) keeps code-adjacent
  prose from being flagged — toggle it in Settings → Spell Check (default on). Pure-Java (Apache Lucene
  Hunspell).
- **Code intelligence (LSP)** _(Beta)_ — language smarts via the Language Server Protocol, with **22 servers**
  auto-detected on `PATH` (Java/JDT LS, TypeScript/JavaScript, Python/Pyright, Go, Rust, C/C++/clangd,
  C#, PHP, Ruby, Kotlin, Lua, Bash, XML, JSON, YAML, HTML, CSS, Dockerfile, SQL, Terraform, TOML, Typst/tinymist).
  Inline diagnostics + a Problems tool window (`M-8`) + minimap/scrollbar stripes, go-to-definition
  (`M-.`), find references (`M-?`), hover docs (`C-c h`), LSP-backed completion, auto-imports, and
  **Format Document** (whole-file reformat via the server, when it advertises formatting — palette or the
  editor right-click menu). Off by default; per-server command + enable in *Settings → LSP*.
- **Search** — incremental find bar (`C-s`/`C-r`) with regex, case, and whole-word toggles, a match
  count, and live highlight-all; **Find in Files** (`C-S-f`) across the project + open buffers with
  include/exclude file globs, query history, regex capture-group replace (`$1`), `.gitignore` exclusion
  (skips `target/`, `node_modules/`, … by default — Settings → Search), and a results tool
  window (`M-6`, on the right, with a *ripgrep* badge when that faster `.gitignore`-aware backend is
  active); and **AceJump** (`M-g j`) — type a character, then a label, to fly the caret to any on-screen
  occurrence.
- **Run a file from a gutter ▶** — a green play glyph runs a Java 25 compact-source file
  (`java <file>`), a Python script (`python3`), or a shell script (`bash`); output streams into a Run
  tool window (`M-9`) with clickable stack traces, stdin, and per-file program arguments. Gated by the
  LSP feature.
- **Debugging (DAP)** _(Beta)_ — a full debugger for **Java**, **Python** (debugpy), and **JavaScript/Node**
  (vscode-js-debug): breakpoints (conditional / logpoints), step / resume / pause / run-to-cursor /
  jump-to-line, call stack, variables, watches and set-value, inline values and a value-hover popup, and
  an IntelliJ-style Debug tool window (`M-g d`). Off by default (*Settings → Debugging*); adapters are
  user-installed (helper scripts provided).
- **Read-only / View mode** — toggle a buffer read-only (`C-x C-q` or the palette) to view without
  editing; typing and edit commands are blocked while everything else keeps working. Files that aren't
  writable on disk open read-only automatically, and the per-file state is remembered across restarts.
  A Word-style "View Mode" banner docks above the editor with an **Enable Editing** button (when the
  file is writable). While read-only, Space pages down and Backspace pages up (pager-style).
- **Simple UI mode** — a single toggle (toolbar icon, **View: Toggle Simple UI Mode** in the palette,
  *Settings → Application*, or the `--simple` launch flag) that strips the window to a minimal editing
  surface: it hides the extra toolbar groups (new-from-template, recent, find-in-files, split, project
  selector), the tool-window stripe, the breadcrumb,
  the entire gutter (line numbers + fold chevrons + markers; collapsed regions are unfolded first), the
  minimap, and most status-bar segments (git, LSP, language, tab size, line endings, encoding), while
  keeping the tabs, the essential toolbar icons (including **Open**), and the file-size segment. It also **disables the heavier features** — language
  servers (LSP), debugging, the HTTP client, Git, and multiple cursors / column selection — for a quiet
  plain editor. Persists across restarts; your saved preferences (line numbers, minimap, breadcrumb, tool
  stripe, LSP/debug/HTTP/Git and multi-caret enables) are all restored when you turn it off.
- **Zen & Expert modes** — per-window distraction-free overlays that hide chrome without touching your saved
  preferences. **Zen** (`C-c z`, floating "Z" to exit) hides everything — toolbar, status bar, tab bar,
  breadcrumb, tool stripes, line numbers, minimap, ruler. **Expert** (`C-c C-e`, floating "E" to exit) is a
  lighter version that strips only the surrounding window chrome (toolbar, tab bar, breadcrumb, tool stripes,
  whitespace guides) and **keeps the whole editor view** — line numbers, status bar, minimap, ruler and
  current-line highlight — a focused coding surface that still shows where you are. The two are mutually
  exclusive; both are also in *Settings → Interface → Modes*, the palette (**View: Toggle Zen/Expert Mode**),
  and a launch flag (`--zen` / `--expert`).
- **Text zoom** — scale the editor text on top of the font size (status-bar `− 100% +`, `C-=`/`C--`/`C-0`,
  Ctrl+mouse-wheel, or the palette); persists across restarts, separate from the font-size setting.
- **Themes** — 26 switchable AtlantaFX themes: the built-in Primer, Nord, Cupertino and Dracula,
  plus the community set (Blue, Navy, Army, the Spring/Summer/Fall/Winter seasonal pairs, Autumn,
  Browny, News and Yacht). Each has a matching editor color theme (syntax + surface) that follows the
  app theme by default and is independently selectable in Settings; the community themes use an
  adaptive syntax palette drawn from each theme's own colors.
- **Markdown preview** — IntelliJ-style 3-mode view (Editor / Editor + Preview / Preview) via a
  floating control top-right of the editor, rendered natively (CommonMark + GFM: tables, task lists,
  strikethrough, autolinks, plus **YAML front matter**, **footnotes**, **heading anchors**, and
  **`++inserted++`** text) with **GitHub-style** output — task-list checkboxes, inline-code pills,
  underlined h1/h2, and **images** (local and remote). Live-updating and theme-matched; the mode is
  remembered per file. **Links are clickable** — a hand cursor + click opens the destination in the
  system default browser. In Split mode the editor and preview scroll together (the pane under the mouse
  drives the other). Zoom the preview text with its `−`/`+` control or, in Preview mode,
  **Ctrl + mouse wheel**. The **Structure** tool window shows the document's heading outline.
- **Markdown authoring** — **paste or drag-drop images** into a saved Markdown file (saved into a sibling
  `assets/` folder with an `![](…)` link inserted), **smart link paste** (paste a URL over a selection to
  make `[selection](url)`), and **table editing** with **Tab** / **Shift-Tab** to move between cells and
  **Enter** to add a row (reflowing as you go) — alongside the existing format bar and smart list/heading
  editing.
- **Markdown lint** — a markdownlint-style rule set (heading-level increment, hard tabs, trailing
  whitespace, blank-line runs, heading-marker spacing/indent/trailing-punctuation, headings & fenced code
  surrounded by blank lines, multiple H1, first-line H1, fenced blocks missing a language, bare URLs,
  missing final newline, broken reference links) shown as inline squiggles with hover messages, a
  scrollbar **overview stripe** + minimap ticks, and a **Markdown Lint** tool window. Disable individual
  rules in Settings (or with `<!-- markdownlint-disable MDxxx -->` comments / a `.markdownlint.json`),
  and **auto-fix** the mechanical issues with "Markdown Lint: Fix Issues". On by default; toggle with
  "View: Toggle Markdown Lint".
- **LaTeX math** — render inline `$…$` and display `$$…$$` math in the preview (and block formulas in PDF
  export) via the pure-Java **JLaTeXMath**, with GitHub-style delimiter rules so prose dollar amounts are
  left alone. **On by default** — toggle under *Settings → Editor → Render LaTeX math* or with
  "View: Toggle Math Rendering".
- **Mermaid diagrams** — render Mermaid in the preview (standalone `.mmd` files and ` ```mermaid `
  fenced blocks inside Markdown), export a diagram to **SVG / PNG / PDF**, get live `maid` linting with
  inline error squiggles, and keyword + snippet autocomplete in `.mmd` files. Uses the external
  **mmdc** (mermaid-cli) to render/export and **maid** to lint (configure their commands in Settings).
  **On by default** when the `mmdc` CLI is found (inert otherwise) — toggle under *Settings → Mermaid*.
  `mmdc` drives a headless Chrome via Puppeteer; if rendering fails with *"Could not find Chrome …"*
  install it once with `npx puppeteer browsers install chrome-headless-shell` (on Linux a global
  `npm i -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli` sometimes skips Chrome's download). The in-app
  **Settings → Mermaid → Install…** button (and the `install.mermaidSupport` command) now does this for
  you — it installs mmdc *and* that Chrome.
- **Diagram-as-code preview (Graphviz DOT + PlantUML)** — standalone `.dot`/`.gv` and
  `.puml`/`.plantuml` files get the same 3-mode preview as Markdown/Mermaid, rendered off-thread via the
  external **`dot`** / **`plantuml`** CLIs (both rasterize to PNG natively — no headless browser) and
  cached by source hash. Zoom resizes the image; export a diagram to **SVG / PNG / PDF**
  (`diagram.export`). **On by default** — self-gating on detection, so it's inert until the tool is found
  (install via your package manager, e.g. `brew install graphviz plantuml`). Toggle + tool paths under
  *Settings → Languages & Tools → Diagrams*.
- **Typst document preview** — standalone `.typ` files get the same 3-mode preview as Markdown, rendered
  off-thread via the external **`typst`** CLI as a **multi-page** stack (one image per page). The last good
  render stays on screen while you edit (no flicker), and a compile error keeps it visible under a small
  banner. Zoom resizes the pages; export to **PDF** (native single file) / **PNG** / **SVG**
  (`typst.export`), and print paginates the pages. **On by default** — self-gating on detection, so it's
  inert until `typst` is found (install via your package manager, e.g. `brew install typst` or
  `cargo install typst-cli`). Toggle + tool path under *Settings → Languages & Tools → Typst*. Editing has
  Markdown-style ergonomics — Enter continues a `-`/`+`/`N.` list, and selecting text pops a format bar
  (bold `*` / emphasis `_` / raw `` ` `` / link / bullet / heading) with matching right-click + palette
  actions.
- **Structured-data preview (JSON / YAML / TOML / XML + OpenAPI docs)** — `.json`/`.yaml`/`.toml` files get
  the same 3-mode preview as Markdown: a collapsible, type-colored **data tree** (rendered off-thread);
  `.xml` files render a faithful **DOM tree** (tags + attributes + text). A JSON/YAML file recognized as an
  **OpenAPI 3 / Swagger 2** spec instead renders as **browsable API docs** (endpoints with colored method
  badges, params, responses, schemas), with a tree ⇄ docs toggle (`structured.toggleView`). **On by
  default** — *Settings → Editor → Structured data*.
- **SVG image preview** — `.svg` files stay editable XML but gain a rendered-image preview in the same
  3-mode view; edit the source and the image re-renders live (rasterized via the bundled JSVG — no external
  tool). **On by default** — *Settings → Editor → SVG*.
- **Crontab schedule preview** — a `crontab` / `*.cron` / `cron.d/*` file gets the same 3-mode preview,
  decoding each schedule into plain English (`30 2 * * 1-5` → "At 02:30, Monday through Friday"), listing
  the next fire times, handling `@reboot`/`@daily`/… macros, and flagging a malformed line with its field
  error. **On by default** — *Settings → Editor → Crontab*.
- **fstab mount preview** — an `/etc/fstab` file gets the same 3-mode preview, decoding each mount line
  into plain English: the device spec (UUID/LABEL/path/CIFS/NFS), mount point, filesystem, the options
  (`noatime` → "access times not updated", `nofail`, `uid=`, …), and the fsck/dump columns; malformed
  lines turn red. **On by default** — *Settings → Editor → fstab*.
- **systemd unit preview** — a `.service`/`.timer`/`.socket`/… file gets the same 3-mode preview, glossing
  each directive in plain English; a `.timer`'s `OnCalendar=` is decoded into English + the next trigger
  times. **On by default** — *Settings → Editor → systemd*.
- **SSH config preview** — an `~/.ssh/config` / `ssh_config` file gets a one-line connection summary per
  `Host` block ("Connects to example.com on port 2222 as deploy, via jump host bastion") + option glosses.
  **On by default** — *Settings → Editor → SSH config*.
- **Dockerfile preview** — a Dockerfile gets a per-build-stage digest (base image, exposed ports, workdir,
  user, entrypoint/command, health check, build-step count). **On by default** — *Settings → Editor → Dockerfile*.
- **GitHub Actions preview** — a workflow YAML (detected by content) renders a plain-English digest — the
  triggers (with a `schedule:` cron decoded), then each job's runner, `needs`/`if`, and steps. **On by
  default** — *Settings → Editor → GitHub Actions*.
- **PDF viewer** — `.pdf` files open in a read-only page viewer (rasterized via the bundled PDFBox) with
  ◀/▶ page navigation and zoom, instead of the hex viewer. Works for local and remote (SFTP) PDFs.
- **Build-tool support (Maven, npm, Cargo, Go, Gradle)** — each detected build tool gets its own IntelliJ-style
  **tasks tool window** (its stripe appears only when the tool's marker file is present): a browsable tree of
  the tool's goals/scripts/targets with a mini toolbar (Run / Reload / Stop / Run custom…), double-click or
  Enter to run, streaming to a shared **Build Output** window with one tab per tool (Maven/npm/Cargo/Go/Gradle).
  The same actions are also a searchable command-palette popup (`<tool>.showActions`):
  - **Maven** (`pom.xml`) — the standard lifecycle phases, the pom's declared profiles (checkable, composing
    with a run via `-P`), and each plugin's explicitly-bound goals (`spotless:check`, `jacoco:report`, …),
    plus a "Run custom…" box. Runs prefer the project's own `./mvnw` wrapper, falling back to `mvn` on PATH.
  - **npm** (`package.json`) — one entry per `scripts` name (run portably as `<pm> run <name>`) plus common
    tasks (`install`, `ci`). Uses the detected package manager — npm/yarn/pnpm/bun, from the `packageManager`
    field or the lockfile.
  - **Cargo** (`Cargo.toml`) — the standard subcommands (build/run/test/clippy/fmt/…), any `[[bin]]`/
    `[[example]]` targets (`run --bin X`), and a `--release` toggle that composes into the run.
  - **Go** (`go.mod`/`go.work`) — the standard subcommands over the whole module (`build ./...`, `test ./...`,
    `mod tidy`, …).
  - **Gradle** (`build.gradle[.kts]`) — the common tasks (build/test/assemble/…) plus **Load all tasks…**,
    which enumerates `gradle tasks` on demand. Prefers the project's own `./gradlew` wrapper, else `gradle`.

  Discovery parses the marker file directly (no `mvn help:effective-pom` shell-out, no new dependency) so
  it's instant and offline. **On by default** (each inert until its marker is found) — toggle under
  *Settings → Languages & Tools → Build Tools*.
- **Export to PDF** — export the active file as a real, *searchable* PDF: source code with syntax
  highlighting and optional line numbers (always a light theme), the **Markdown** preview as native
  vector text (headings, lists, tables, images, embedded diagrams), or a standalone Mermaid `.mmd`
  diagram. Run "File: Export to PDF" / "File: Export Preview to PDF" from the palette; choose line
  numbers, syntax highlighting, and page size (Letter / A4) under *Settings → Editor → PDF Export*.
- **Export to HTML** — export a Markdown file's rendered preview to a standalone, self-contained `.html`
  file (embedded stylesheet, heading anchors, math rendered as images). Run "Preview: Export to HTML" from
  the palette.
- **Print** — native printing of code or the rendered Markdown preview, with a print-preview window
  first (always light, what-you-preview-is-what-prints), reusing the PDF layout core. Run "File: Print"
  / "File: Print Preview" from the palette.
- **Snippets** — VS Code / TextMate-style templates with interactive tab stops. Type a prefix + Tab to
  expand, or pick via `C-c i` / "Snippet: Insert…". Prefixes needn't be plain words: `#inc` (C/C++
  `#include`), `!` (the HTML skeleton), `?xml` and yaml's `---` all expand. Tab/Shift-Tab cycle fields, placeholders are
  pre-selected, mirrors update live, `$0` is the final caret. Standard body syntax (`$1`,
  `${1:default}`, mirrors, choices, variables, escapes). Snippets ship for all 21 highlighted languages
  (most from the MIT [friendly-snippets](https://github.com/rafamadriz/friendly-snippets) collection);
  add your own in `~/.editora/snippets/<language>.json` (user snippets override bundled).
- **File templates** _(Beta)_ — "New File From Template" (`C-c C-n`) creates a file (or a whole set of files) from
  a reusable template, prompting for any `${variables}` in a wizard and placing the caret at `${cursor}`.
  Bundled templates (Java class, HTML page / multi-file bundle, Markdown doc, Python script) plus your
  own in `~/.editora/templates/`.
- **Autocomplete** — appears as you type (and on demand via `C-M-i` / `M-/`). In **code**, a popup of
  **snippet** completions (accepting expands the snippet with its tab stops; Enter/Tab accept, arrows
  navigate). In **prose** (plain text / Markdown), inline **"ghost text"** — a single greyed
  continuation after the caret from the spell dictionary + your personal dictionary; **Tab** accepts.
  Settings → Editor has a master toggle plus per-source checkboxes (words/prose, snippets).
- **Welcome page** — a VSCode-style start panel (New File / Open File / recent files) shown in the editor
  area when no files are open, instead of a blank Untitled buffer; `--new-file[=name]` opens a fresh buffer
  instead.
- **Recent files** — persistent most-recently-used list.
- **Image viewer** — opening a raster image (`.png`, `.jpg`/`.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.bmp`) renders the picture in a
  read-only tab instead of dumping its binary bytes as text, with zoom out/in/fit/actual-size (and Ctrl+wheel
  zoom). SVG stays editable text.
- **Hex viewer** — opening a binary file (executable, archive, `.class`, `.pdf`, …) shows a read-only
  `offset | hex | ASCII` dump instead of garbage text. Binaries are detected by content; large files show
  their first slice with a truncation note. "View: Open as Hex" force-opens any file's bytes as hex.
- **File-type icons** — every file shows a glyph for its type (the Java/Python/CSS/… logo, an image,
  archive, PDF, table, … glyph, or a generic document fallback) everywhere it's listed: editor tabs, the
  Project tree, the Open-Files / Recent pickers, the Switcher, and the file/folder finders. Monochrome
  single-path glyphs that track the light/dark theme (Simple Icons + Material Design Icons).
- **TODO Comment Manager** — `TODO`, `FIXME`, `HACK`, `NOTE`, `XXX` (and your own keywords) are highlighted
  wherever they appear, and understood in the IntelliJ-style structured form `KEYWORD [tag] (priority) description`
  — e.g. `// TODO [auth] (high) fix token refresh` — with each part colored (tag underlined; priority by level).
  The **TODO tool window** (`M-g o`) lists every match with a **Group by** selector (File / Priority / Tag /
  Keyword), and right-clicking a match edits it in your source: **Mark Done** (→ `DONE`) / Reopen, set the
  priority, or edit the description — as one undoable edit. Configure the keywords/colors in
  Settings → Editor → TODO Highlighting.
- **Bookmarks** — toggle line bookmarks (`C-c m`) with a gutter marker and optional notes; the
  Bookmarks tool window lists them across all files, `C-c ]`/`C-c [` cycle within a file, and `M-g b`
  is a cross-file jump picker. Reorder bookmarks (and file groups) in the tool window with Alt+Up/Down,
  the right-click menu, or drag-and-drop — the jump picker follows the same order. Saved in
  `bookmarks.json`, scoped per project (switching projects shows that project's bookmarks; deleting a
  project deletes its bookmarks).
- **Personal Notes** — private annotations attached to a file *without modifying the file* (ideal for
  read-only, generated, or shared code). Add a note on a word, line, or selection range
  (`C-c n`, the editor right-click menu, or the gutter glyph); give it a body, tags, and a status
  (active / resolved / orphaned). Notes follow their content as you edit and re-anchor on reopen by the
  captured text + context — and by **content hash**, so they survive a file being renamed or moved
  outside the app (a note that can't be relocated is kept as *orphaned*, never lost). A gutter glyph, a
  soft in-editor highlight, and a hover tooltip mark each note (toggle via *Settings → Editor → Show note
  indicators*). The **Personal Notes** tool window (`M-5`) groups them per file with a filter and
  edit/resolve/delete; `M-g n` jumps across files and notes export to JSON. Stored per project in
  `notes.json`. Separate from bookmarks — both coexist in the gutter. **On by default** — toggle
  under *Settings → Application → Enable Personal Notes*.
- **Git** _(Beta)_ — uses your installed `git` (no bundled library). The status bar shows the current branch with
  ahead/behind counts (click to switch branches); the gutter draws change bars vs `HEAD` (added /
  modified / deleted); and the **Commit** tool window (`M-4`) lists Staged / Changes / Untracked files with
  stage, unstage, discard, **Stage All**, and a commit box. Palette/keys cover commit (`C-x g`), stage
  current file, switch/new branch, fetch/pull/push, and **clone** ("Git: Clone Repository…" clones a
  repo and opens a file from it — independent of projects). A **Git Log** tool window (`M-g h`, or *Show
  File History* on a tab) browses commits — select one to see its files, double-click for a read-only
  diff, right-click to Copy Hash / Checkout / Reset / Revert / Cherry-Pick / New Branch. **Inline blame**
  (`M-g a`, GitLens-style) annotates the current line with "author, time ago • summary" (toggle in
  *Settings → Git*, off by default). **Stash** push / pop / apply / drop from the palette or the branch
  dropdown. All off the UI thread; **on by default** but hidden when not in a repo or when `git` isn't on `PATH`.
- **Diff viewer & merge** _(Beta)_ — compare files in a dedicated tab: side-by-side or unified, with word-level
  intra-line highlights, prev/next-change navigation, apply-a-hunk / apply-all (undoable), live refresh,
  and patch export. Diff against `HEAD` (`C-x v =`), another commit, or any other file; open a `.patch`/
  `.diff` file's own content as a structured diff (right-click a patch tab → "Open in Diff Viewer"); a
  separate merge-conflict resolver accepts ours / theirs / both per conflict.
- **Local file history** — IntelliJ-style snapshots of local files, taken on save, auto-save, and before an
  external-change reload, independent of any VCS. A **File History** tool window (`M-g l`) lists each revision
  (date/time, reason, size; the latest tagged *Current*); double-click for a read-only diff against the
  current file, or restore one (an undoable whole-file replace). Snapshots are deduped by content and stored
  gzip-compressed under `<configDir>/history/`, pruned by configurable limits (revisions/file, age,
  size/project). On by default; local-only; off in Simple UI mode.
- **HTTP client** _(Beta)_ — open a `.http`/`.rest` file and click the green ▶ next to a request to run it with
  Editora's **built-in** HTTP client; the response (status, headers, pretty-printed JSON body, timing/
  size) shows in the file's **preview** — the same Editor/Split/Preview view Markdown and CSV use, so the
  floating toggle top-right switches between the requests, a side-by-side view, and the response alone.
  Running a request opens the split for you. The viewer is content-type-highlighted and keeps an in-session
  history, **Copy as cURL** / **Import cURL**, and Open-in-editor. Close to IntelliJ's HTTP Client: `{{var}}`/
  `@var` substitution and **dynamic variables** (`{{$random.*}}`, `{{$datetime}}` with date math, `{{$dotenv.X}}`,
  …), **request chaining** (reference an earlier request's response), **multipart** and external-file bodies,
  **environment files** (`http-client.env.json` + a `$shared` section) with a picker, **Basic/Digest auth**
  shorthand, automatic URL encoding, response-to-file redirects, per-request directives, run-whole-file, and
  saving the response. On by default (*Settings → HTTP Client*).
- **HTML live preview** _(Beta)_ — a floating browser icon on any HTML file opens it in a detected desktop
  browser (Safari, Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or the system default), served over a tiny **loopback** web server
  so its CSS/JS/images load. The page **reloads live as you type** (unsaved edits included). On by default
  (*Settings → HTML Preview*); no external tool — it uses the JDK's built-in HTTP server.
- **Remote files (SFTP)** _(Beta)_ — connect to a server over SSH/SFTP (*Remote: Connect to SFTP…*) and edit its
  files as if they were local: the remote folder mounts in the Project tool window, and open/edit/save go
  straight over SFTP. Authenticates with your default `~/.ssh` keys, a chosen key file, or a password;
  saved connections (metadata only — never a password) reconnect via a picker, a **Remote Sites** tool window
  (`M-g r`), a **Settings → Remote** management page (add/edit/remove sites), or a quick-connect list on the
  Welcome page — each reopens the connection form pre-filled. Features that need a local process (language
  servers, debugging, Git, Run, the HTTP client) auto-disable for remote files. Off by default; built on
  Apache MINA SSHD.
- **Plugins** — extend Editora without forking it. A plugin is a folder under `<configDir>/plugins/<id>/`
  with a `plugin.json` manifest plus, optionally, a Java jar and asset dirs. A **Java SPI**
  (`com.editora.plugin.Plugin`) can add palette commands, keybindings, dockable tool windows, editor
  right-click items, and status-bar segments; a **declarative manifest** adds keymap bindings, external
  commands, and `snippets/`/`templates/` dirs — no code. Loaded via a child class loader, so the same jar
  works in dev and in the packaged installers. **Off by default and full-trust** (no sandbox) — enable it,
  and each plugin, in *Settings → Plugins*. **Install** by browsing a curated GitHub-hosted registry or from
  a local `.zip`. Security: the registry `index.json` is verified against a bundled **Ed25519 signature**
  (*Require signed plugins*, default on, blocks an unsigned/unverified registry); downloads are
  **SHA-256-verified** over HTTPS with bounded reads; and a **capability-disclosure** confirm (does it run
  code? which external commands? which keybindings?) is shown before any plugin is enabled. Signing proves
  *who* published — not a sandbox. See [`docs/plugins.md`](docs/plugins.md), the reference
  [`examples/example-plugin/`](examples/example-plugin/), and the live registry (every plugin's source +
  a signed `index.json`) at [adriandeleon/editora-plugins](https://github.com/adriandeleon/editora-plugins).
- **AI** _(Beta)_ — AI Agent and AI actions live under one **AI** group in Settings, gated by a single
  master **Enable AI** switch (off by default; palette `view.toggleAiEnabled`) that turns off *every* AI
  feature at once — agent chat, commit-message generation, explain/rewrite selection, and inline
  completion — regardless of their own settings below it. Does not affect the MCP server.
- **AI actions** _(Beta)_ — one-shot AI features that call the Anthropic API directly (streamed, no SDK):
  generate a **commit message** from the staged diff into the Commit window, **explain the selection** in
  a new Markdown buffer, or **rewrite the selection** per an instruction as a single undoable edit. Plus
  **AI inline completion**: after a typing pause, a muted one-line ghost suggestion at the caret — Tab
  accepts (its own fast model, default `claude-haiku-4-5`). Off by default (Settings → AI Actions); model
  configurable (default `claude-opus-4-8`); API key from `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or a Settings override.
  **Local models**: switch the Provider to *Local (OpenAI-compatible)* to run every AI feature against
  LM Studio, Ollama, or any local OpenAI-compatible server — no API key, configurable endpoint.
- **AI Agent** _(Beta)_ — chat with an embedded coding agent over the
  [Agent Client Protocol](https://agentclientprotocol.com) (ACP). The default command is
  `claude-code-acp` (Claude Code's ACP adapter; any ACP agent works via Settings → AI Agent). The
  agent's file reads see open buffers' unsaved text, and its edits to open files apply as **undoable
  buffer edits** you review and save; permission requests pop a dialog. Off by default; the agent is a
  user-installed external tool, never bundled.
- **MCP server** _(Beta)_ — embed a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server in the
  running editor so an LLM agent (Claude Code, etc.) can observe live editor state, edit files, and drive the
  command registry. A small **loopback-only** HTTP/JSON-RPC server with **bearer-token auth** exposes fourteen
  tools — reads (`list_open_files`, `list_tabs`, `read_buffer`, `get_selection`, `get_diagnostics`,
  `document_symbols`, `git_status`, `todo_scan`, `find_in_files`, `list_commands`), writes (`edit_buffer` — undoable str-replace edits —
  `save_buffer`), and actions (`open_file`, `execute_command`) — and writes its endpoint to
  `<configDir>/mcp-endpoint.json` for discovery. A status-bar
  **MCP** indicator shows when it's running (click to copy the connection command). Off by default and
  guarded by a security-notice dialog — enable it under *Settings → MCP Server* (or the **Toggle MCP Server**
  command). No external tool or new dependency (the JDK's built-in `HttpServer`).
- **Tool windows** — IntelliJ-style dockable panels (Project, Commit, Git Log, File History, Structure, File
  Information, Bookmarks, Personal Notes, Problems, Search Results, Run, Debug, HTTP Client) — plus any
  contributed by a plugin.
- **Settings** — a category sidebar (Appearance, Editor, Tool Windows, Spell Check, Application, …) with a
  search box, a live font/theme preview, and Reset to Defaults. Changes apply instantly.
- **Multi-language interface** — run Editora in **English, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese, or
  German**. Pick a language under Settings → Appearance → Language (default *Automatic* follows your
  system language, falling back to English); the change applies on the next restart.

## Available plugins

A curated registry of ready-to-install plugins lives at
[adriandeleon/editora-plugins](https://github.com/adriandeleon/editora-plugins) (the baked-in default).
Enable plugins in *Settings → Plugins*, then **Browse plugins…** to install any of these (or *Install from
file…* for a local `.zip`). Each plugin's full source is in that repo under `plugins/<id>/`.

| Plugin | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **Example Plugin** | Reference plugin exercising every extension point (command, keybinding, tool window, editor menu item, status-bar segment, snippet). |
| **Lorem Ipsum** | Insert a lorem-ipsum paragraph, or replace the selection with one. |
| **Text Tools** | Transform the selection/document: case convert, sort, unique, reverse, trim trailing, squeeze blank lines. |
| **Encode Tools** | Encode/decode: Base64, URL, HTML entities, ROT13, hex. |
| **Hash Tools** | Hash text to a hex digest — MD5 / SHA-1 / SHA-256. |
| **JSON / XML Tools** | JSON pretty-print / minify and XML pretty-print. |
| **Slug & Sequence** | Slugify text; number lines; fill a column with `1..N`. |
| **Box Banner** | Wrap the selection in an ASCII box banner. |
| **Insert Tools** | Insert a UUID or the current date/time at the caret. |
| **Markdown TOC** | Insert a table of contents built from the document's headings. |
| **Format Runner** | Format the active file with an external formatter (prettier/black/gofmt/rustfmt/clang-format). |
| **Open on GitHub** | Open the active file at the caret line on its remote's web UI. |
| **Scratchpad** | A persistent scratchpad tool window (auto-saved). |
| **Regex Tester** | A live regex tester tool window (pattern + flags + match spans/groups). |
| **Color Picker** | Pick a color and insert it as HEX / `rgb()` / `rgba()`. |
| **Word Count** | Live word/line/character count + reading time for the active buffer. |
| **Calculator** | Evaluate arithmetic expressions and insert the result. |
| **Task Runner** | Run a shell task (`npm`/`make`/…) in the file's directory and stream output. |

## Requirements

- JDK 25+
- Maven 3.9+

## Build & Run

A Maven wrapper is included, so no local Maven install is required — use `./mvnw`
(or `mvnw.cmd` on Windows). Plain `mvn` works too if you have Maven installed.

```bash
# Run the app
./mvnw javafx:run

# Run tests
./mvnw test

# Build a native app image / installer (DMG on macOS, MSI on Windows, DEB on Linux)
./mvnw -Pdist package

# Build a runnable fat jar, then launch it
./mvnw -Pfatjar package
java -jar target/Editora-<version>.jar
```

The `dist` profile produces a platform installer under `target/dist/`.

On **Linux**, the `.deb` installs the app under `/opt/editora/`, registers it in the application menu
(with the Editora icon), and adds an **`editora` command on `PATH`** (a `/usr/bin/editora` symlink
created by the package's maintainer scripts), so you can launch it from the menu or from a terminal
with arguments — e.g. `editora some/file.java:42` or `editora --new-file=notes.md`. The menu entry and
command are removed when you uninstall the package. (The `.rpm` installs under `/opt/editora/` too; run
`/opt/editora/bin/Editora` or add your own symlink.)

Linux releases also ship a **portable install tarball** (`Editora-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz`, x64 +
arm64) for systems without `.deb`/`.rpm` (or where you'd rather not use a package manager). It bundles the
same self-contained app image (its own jlink'd Java runtime — no system Java needed) plus an `install.sh`:

```bash
tar xzf Editora-<version>-linux-x64.tar.gz && cd editora-x86_64
./install.sh          # per-user  -> ~/.local/editora  (+ ~/.local/bin/editora)
sudo ./install.sh     # system    -> /opt/editora       (+ /usr/local/bin/editora)
./install.sh --uninstall   # remove it again
```

Either way it adds an `editora` command and an application-menu entry (with the Editora icon). You can also
run it in place without installing: `./Editora/bin/Editora`. Build one locally from an app-image with
`./mvnw clean -Pdist -DskipTests -Djpackage.type=APP_IMAGE package` then
`scripts/build-tarball.sh target/dist/Editora target/dist`.

The `fatjar` profile produces a self-contained, runnable `target/Editora-<version>.jar` (no separate
JavaFX install needed — `java -jar` is enough, on a JDK 25 runtime). It bundles JavaFX's classes and
native libraries **for the build host's platform only**: a single jar can't be portable because
JavaFX's macOS/Linux x64 and arm64 native libraries share filenames and would collide. To get a jar
for another OS/arch, build the profile on that platform (or grab the per-platform jars from a
[release](#releases)).

On startup the fat jar prints `WARNING: Unsupported JavaFX configuration: classes were loaded from
'unnamed module …'`. This is harmless and expected: JavaFX notes that it's running from the
classpath rather than the module path (which is how a fat jar works). The app runs normally, and the
warning cannot be cleanly suppressed — the native installers launch from the module path and don't
show it.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the workflow, and the **developer documentation** in
[`docs/`](docs/README.md) — architecture, the conventions a change must follow, performance rules, an
extension cookbook (add a command / LSP server / grammar / tool window / overlay), and build/test/release
guides. (User-facing docs live in the separate website repo; `docs/` is for contributors.)

All Java is auto-formatted with [Palantir Java Format](https://github.com/palantir/palantir-java-format)
(a lambda-friendly, 120-column fork of google-java-format), enforced by the
[Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless) Maven plugin. **Run `./mvnw spotless:apply` before
committing** — `spotless:check` is bound to the `verify` phase, so `./mvnw verify`, `./mvnw package`,
and CI fail on unformatted code (the `javafx:run` / `compile` dev loop is deliberately left untouched).
The pipeline removes unused imports, formats, then orders imports into three blank-line-separated groups
(JDK → `javafx` → third-party + `com.editora`, static imports last). Wrap hand-aligned code in
`// spotless:off` … `// spotless:on` to opt out.

Two conventions the build checks for:

- **Every user-facing string is localized.** Add new keys to all six
  `src/main/resources/com/editora/i18n/messages[_<lang>].properties` catalogs (English base +
  `it`/`es`/`fr`/`pt`/`de`); the test suite fails if any locale is missing a key.
- **Every action is a command.** User-facing features are registered in the command registry so they
  appear in the command palette (`M-x`); toolbar buttons and keybindings dispatch through commands too.

Tests are mostly pure logic, plus a headless-FX harness for toolkit-bound behavior (TestFX over JavaFX 26's
built-in headless platform, no display/xvfb) —
run all with `./mvnw test`, or the pure suite alone with `./mvnw test -DexcludedGroups=fx`. `./mvnw verify`
also enforces the Spotless check and the JaCoCo per-package coverage floors. See
[`docs/testing.md`](docs/testing.md).

For **manual** smoke-testing and demos there's a curated, feature-organized sample corpus under
[`samples/`](samples/README.md) (syntax per language, folding, markdown, mermaid, todo, spell, search,
editorconfig, http, log, diff, encodings — open the relevant file to exercise a feature). Large perf
inputs are generated on demand by `java scripts/GenSamples.java` (a JDK 25 compact source file;
git-ignored output, not committed).

## Releases

Tagged releases publish native installers **and runnable fat jars** to
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/adriandeleon/Editora/releases) for Linux (x64 and arm64),
macOS (x64 and arm64), and Windows (x64). A GitHub Actions matrix builds each installer with `-Pdist`
and the matching `Editora-<version>-<platform>.jar` with `-Pfatjar` on its own runner, and
[JReleaser](https://jreleaser.org) assembles the release (config in `jreleaser.yml`). Prefer the
installer for a normal setup; the fat jar is handy if you already have a JDK 25 and just want
`java -jar`.

To cut a release: bump `<version>` in `pom.xml`, commit, then push a matching tag:

```bash
git tag v1.2.3 && git push origin v1.2.3
```

A `-rcN` suffix (e.g. `v1.2.3-rc1`) is published as a pre-release. Installers are currently
**unsigned**, so macOS Gatekeeper / Windows SmartScreen will warn on first launch.

**Update notifications:** on startup (at most once a day) Editora checks GitHub for a newer release and shows a
subtle "Update: X.Y.Z" indicator in the status bar when one is available — click it to open the release page.
*Check for Updates* in the command palette checks on demand, and the About dialog shows an update link. Automatic
checks are on by default and can be disabled in Settings → Workspace → Updates (they contact GitHub's API over
HTTPS and send no data). Pre-releases are ignored — only full releases trigger a notice.

## Command line

```
editora [options] [FILE[:LINE[:COLUMN]] ...]

  --config-dir <path>   Use <path> as the config directory (or set EDITORA_CONFIG_DIR)
  --dev                 Dev mode: use ~/.editora-dev (separate from production config)
  --project[=]<dir>     Open <dir> as a project (only when Projects are enabled; ignored otherwise)
  --new-file[=name]     Open a new buffer instead of the Welcome page (optionally named, e.g. notes.md)
  --single-window[=project]  Open just one window (the named project, else the no-project window)
                        instead of restoring all windows; session-only, doesn't change the saved layout
  --zen                 Start in Zen (distraction-free) mode (session only)
  --expert              Start in Expert mode: like Zen, but keeps the editor
                        view (line numbers, status bar) (session only)
  --simple              Start in Simple UI mode (minimal chrome; session only)
  --version, -V         Print the version and exit
  --help, -h            Print help and exit

  FILE                  Open FILE (also FILE:LINE and FILE:LINE:COLUMN to jump)
```

File and `--project` arguments are **additive**: your previous session restores as usual, then the
given file(s) open on top (focused) and the editor jumps to any `LINE:COLUMN`. `--version`/`--help`
print and exit without opening a window. Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Configuration

User preferences live in `~/.editora/settings.toml` (font, theme, keymap, tab size,
view options, auto-save mode, and keybinding overrides). Session state — collapsed fold
regions and tool-window layout — is stored as JSON in `workspace-state.json`, recent
files in `recent-files.json`, bookmarks and breakpoints (scoped per project) in `bookmarks.json` /
`breakpoints.json`, personal notes (also scoped per project) in `notes.json`, and saved SFTP
connections (metadata only, never a password) in `connections.json`, all alongside it.

To use a different config folder, pass `--config-dir <path>` (or `--config-dir=<path>`) on the command
line, or set the `EDITORA_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable. Precedence is **`--config-dir` >
`EDITORA_CONFIG_DIR` > `--dev` (`~/.editora-dev/`) > the default `~/.editora/`**. Works on macOS,
Linux, and Windows.

For running a development instance alongside your everyday editor, pass `--dev` to use a separate
`~/.editora-dev/` config directory, so the two never share settings or session state. (`--config-dir`
and `EDITORA_CONFIG_DIR` still take precedence if you also set them.)

Auto save is off by default; enable it in Settings ("After delay" or "On focus change")
or cycle the mode with `C-c a`. It only saves files that already have a path.
