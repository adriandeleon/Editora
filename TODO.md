# Editora — TODO / Roadmap

A backlog of planned features and improvements. Unordered within each section.

## Recently shipped
- [x] **Rebinding a prefix chord silently disables everything under it** (#438) — the keybinding editor's
      conflict check was `keymap.commandFor(chord)`, an **exact** match only, so recording a lone `C-x` (a
      prefix of `C-x C-s`/`C-x C-f`/`C-x C-c`/…) matched nothing → no warning → every `C-x …` binding dead
      (the dispatcher resolves `C-x` to a command before the second key). New pure
      `KeybindingEdits.conflicts(active, proposed, forCommand)` returns the collisions both ways —
      **SHADOWS** (proposed is a prefix of an existing chord → breaks it) and **UNREACHABLE** (an existing
      chord is a prefix of proposed → new one never fires) plus **EXACT** — whole-token prefix (so `C-x` isn't
      a prefix of `C-xy`). `SettingsWindow.rebindWithConflictCheck` lists the affected shortcuts in the confirm
      dialog (6-catalog i18n, apostrophe-safe MessageFormat verified). 6 new unit tests incl. one documenting
      that the old exact-match check saw no conflict where three bindings live.
- [x] **HTTP client silently drops a JDK-rejected header** (#440) — `send()` wrapped `b.header()` in a
      `catch (IllegalArgumentException) { /* skip */ }`, so a header the JDK rejects (a pasted value with a
      trailing `\r\n`, an embedded control char, or a restricted name like `Host`) went out **missing** with no
      status/report note → an unauthenticated request and a mystery `401`. Nuance found by executing the repro:
      `HttpAuth.normalizeHeaders` **already `.strip()`s Authorization**, so that header was fine — but a
      *custom* auth header (`X-Api-Key`/`X-Auth-Token`, common) with the same paste artifact was dropped. New
      pure `HttpHeaders.partition` trims **every** header value (spec-safe OWS strip) and separates the
      sendable from the un-sendable, validating against the real `HttpRequest.Builder`; `run` surfaces the
      un-sendable ones as `HttpResult.warnings` shown atop the report (`HttpResponseFormat`). **Proven end to
      end against a real `com.sun.net.httpserver` server** that reports the header it received: a custom auth
      header with a trailing newline now arrives trimmed (`expected: <sk-secret-123> but was: <null>` on the
      old code), and an injection value (`a\r\nX-Injected: evil`) is surfaced, not sent.
- [x] **Symlinked repo root → "not in repo"** (#434) — `GitService.repoRelative` (and `GitCoordinator.rel`)
      compared a git-reported root (symlink-resolved by `rev-parse --show-toplevel`) against an as-opened file
      path, so `f.startsWith(r)` failed for any repo reached through a symlink (macOS `/tmp → /private/tmp`, a
      symlinked work dir) → null → Compare-with-HEAD / stage / unstage / revert / history all "not in repo".
      Now `repoRelative` symlink-resolves **both** sides via `GitService.realPath` (`toRealPath`, falling back
      to a nearest-existing-ancestor resolve for a not-yet-saved/deleted file, then plain normalize), and
      `GitCoordinator.rel` delegates to it. **Reproduced with real git + a real symlink on this box** (`root`
      = `.../realrepo`, `file` = `.../linked/a.txt` → null before, `a.txt` after); the git commands that take a
      `-- <abspath>` pathspec (gutter diff, blame) were already fine because git resolves the symlink itself.
      Unit test with a real `createSymbolicLink` temp repo fails on the old code (`expected: <a.txt> but was:
      <null>`); the pure fake-path tests still pass via the fallback.
- [x] **SFTP password lifetime (#437, security / defense-in-depth)** — the connect form wipes the `char[]`
      secret, but `session.addPasswordIdentity(new String(secret))` kept a String copy on the **session's
      identity list for the entire connected session** (hours), defeating the wipe at MINA's String-only
      boundary. Since a password is only needed for the initial handshake (SSH re-keys against the host key,
      not the password), `RemoteFileSystems.authenticate` now `removePasswordIdentity`s it in a `finally` right
      after `session.auth()`, shrinking the copy's reachable lifetime from "until disconnect" to "the
      handshake". The unavoidable String at the MINA boundary stays (no `char[]` client API; the issue notes
      this) — this closes the *duration*, not the copy. Auth extracted into a testable `authenticate(session,
      conn, secret, timeout)`; **proven against a real in-process SSH server** — after auth
      `ClientSession.passwordIteratorOf(session)` is empty (success and rejected-password paths both), failing
      on the old code (`expected: <false> but was: <true>`). Completes the SFTP hardening trio (host key #487,
      this).
- [x] **Windows cmd metacharacter injection in "Open Terminal Here"** (#413, security) —
      `DesktopActions.terminalArgv` built `cmd /c start cmd /k "cd /d " + dir`, splicing the folder path into a
      `cmd.exe` command line. A repo shipping a directory named `repo & calc.exe & rem ` (every char legal in a
      Windows folder name) ran `calc.exe` when the user picked Open-Terminal-Here on it. Fixed by construction:
      the path is delivered as the child's **working directory** (`ProcessBuilder.directory`, i.e. CreateProcess
      `lpCurrentDirectory`, parsed by no shell) and the argv is fixed literals (`cmd /c start "" cmd /k`); a new
      `DesktopActions.Command{argv, workingDir}` record carries the split. mac/linux exec their launcher directly
      (no shell) so their path-as-argv was always safe; **Reveal-in-Explorer was never a command-injection vector
      either** — `explorer.exe` is launched directly and runs no subcommand (documented, not "fixed"). The
      injection-closure is proven by a pure test (the malicious path appears in no cmd argument, fails on the old
      code); **the launch behaviour — that `start ""` opens a console inheriting the working directory — is the
      one part unverifiable on macOS and wants a Windows device-test** (per the issue's own caveat).
- [x] **SFTP host-key verification (GHSA-p4qf-p7q6-2mrw)** — the initiative's top open security item, and the
      first of the deferred backlog. `RemoteFileSystems` passed **`AcceptAllServerKeyVerifier`**, so SSH's
      entire security model was off: a MITM on the path presented their own key, Editora connected without a
      word, and with `AuthMethod.PASSWORD` **sent them the password** — plus the plaintext of every file
      browsed/opened/saved, modifiable in flight. Now a `KnownHostsServerKeyVerifier` over **`~/.ssh/known_hosts`**
      (deliberately the same file `ssh` uses — a host already trusted at the terminal doesn't re-prompt, and an
      entry Editora writes is honoured by `ssh`), with the three outcomes SSH requires: known+match → silent;
      **unknown → a trust-on-first-use dialog** showing `host:port`, key type and the `SHA256:` fingerprint,
      written to the file only on acceptance; **known+different → refused outright, without asking** (offering
      a button there is how a MITM gets clicked through). The prompt is a `HostKeyPrompt` injected by
      `RemoteCoordinator`: called on an SSH I/O thread, marshalled to FX, blocking (the handshake can't
      proceed until the user decides), bounded at 2 min so an unanswered dialog can't park an I/O thread, and
      **fails closed** on timeout/interrupt/no-UI. **Proven against a real in-process SSH server and a real
      impostor** — a second `SshServer` on the same port with a different host key: 9 tests across
      `HostKeyVerificationTest` (MINA's contract) + `RemoteFileSystemsHostKeyFxTest` (Editora's wiring, via a
      real SFTP subsystem). All 4 wiring tests fail on the old code, one of them stating the bug exactly:
      `the user said no ==> expected: <false> but was: <true>`. Deferred → #486 (the 20 s connect timeout can
      expire while the host-key dialog is open).
- [x] Appearance / Interface / Tool Windows / Advanced audit — **the last four Settings pages; the initiative's
      final sweep** (23 features audited in all). *Caveat: the audit agent hit its session limit before
      reporting, so this pass is mine alone and is narrower than the others — Themes/UserThemes CSS loading and
      the ToolWindowManager available-vs-visible round-trip were NOT covered and are still worth a look.*
      **User themes now survive real-world files:** a theme that points the standard tokens at its own palette
      (`-color-bg-default: -color-dark-1;` — ordinary authoring; the bundled themes *and* upstream AtlantaFX
      all use literal hex, which is why the happy path hid it) parsed as *no colour* → bg defaulted to white
      and `dark=false`, so a dark theme rendered dark chrome around a white editor with the light syntax
      palette; `parseColor` now follows the reference (bounded, cycle-safe) and no longer matches a longer
      token that merely starts with the one asked for (`-color-bg-default-hover` was returned as the
      background — proven by a test that fails on the old code). And **any** `.css` in the folder became a
      selectable theme: an empty or half-written file showed up in the picker and stripped AtlantaFX from the
      whole app when chosen — a theme must now declare at least one `-color-*`/`-fx-*`.
      **ToolWindowManager's available-vs-visible split: verified CLEAN**, by execution rather than reading —
      a transient `setAvailable(false)` never writes back a preference, an availability round-trip doesn't
      resurrect a window the user hid, and it restores the button without popping the window open. Previously
      only the pure predicate had a test; the manager's state machine now has four.
      **"Reset to Defaults" restored 23 of 181 fields.** A hand-written list of setters that had rotted for
      years: every setting added since (all of AI, LSP, Debug, Mermaid, TODO, the previews, the build tools,
      Simple mode, `keymap`, `uiLanguage`, `fillColumn`…) was missed, so the button silently left ~87% of
      preferences untouched — and left `aiApiKey` sitting there. Replaying the exact old setters against a real
      `Settings` shows it plainly (`aiApiKey: 'sk-ant-…MY-BILLABLE-KEY'` survives a "reset"). Now
      `Settings.resetToDefaults(live)` copies the properties **Jackson already persists** (mutating in place —
      every window holds that instance) and re-applies the two documented exceptions, so a new field is covered
      the day it is added. Verified Jackson *replaces* list-valued settings rather than merging them.
      **And I finished the job I started in #483:** that PR locked `settings.toml` to 0600 but I never grepped
      for the other writers — **`ConfigExporter` zips the whole config dir (key included) into `$HOME` at
      0644**, and `DebugLog`'s `editora-session.log` was 0644 too. Locking the original and not the copy
      protects nothing. Both now go through one shared `ConfigWriter.createOwnerOnly` (a creation attribute, so
      never briefly readable) — the *third* and *fourth* instances of the world-readable-secret shape after MCP
      #467 and AI #483. **When a fix lands on a secret, grep for every other writer of it.**
- [x] AI audit (per-feature bug hunt) — **2 credential leaks**, verified by pointing Editora at a **fake local
      endpoint** and reading the bytes it actually sent. **The critical one needed no user action at all:**
      `AiCoordinator.apiKey()` fell back to `System.getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")` **with no provider check**, so
      a user with that variable exported (universal for Claude Code users) who picked the **OpenAI-compatible**
      provider — the local LM Studio/Ollama path, whose `requiresApiKey()` is *false* because a local server
      needs no key — silently shipped their Anthropic credential to whatever `aiEndpoint` pointed at:
      `Authorization: Bearer sk-ant-api03-…`, captured on the wire, with the Settings key field **empty** so
      nothing on screen suggested a key existed. `aiEndpoint` is free text, so that host need not be loopback.
      Worse, **inline completion** fires it per idle pause, unprompted; and the env key also satisfied the
      `apiKey().isEmpty()` "not configured" gate, so the feature reported itself ready and began transmitting
      code. Now the pure, unit-tested `AiCoordinator.effectiveKey(configured, provider, envKey)` only consults
      the variable for the provider it belongs to. **The second:** `settings.toml` — which holds that key — was
      written with the default umask (**0644**) in a **0755** config dir, i.e. world-readable, the same shape
      the MCP audit (#467) fixed for its bearer token. Fixed at the `ConfigWriter` chokepoint, so it covers
      *every* config file (`notes.json` is private too), as a **creation** attribute (never briefly readable,
      no extra syscall) that also re-tightens a file left 0644 by an older version. **Also: CLAUDE.md
      documented none of it** — zero mentions of `AiService`/`AcpClient`/`AiCoordinator`/`AgentCoordinator`,
      and the Settings bullet still claimed the AI page was "an empty coming-soon placeholder [that] was
      dropped" — for the only feature in the app that transmits the user's source code to a third party. Now
      has an `ai/`+`agent/` bullet carrying the credential invariants. Deferred → #480 (one shared `aiApiKey`
      across providers → switching sends the old key to the new endpoint; needs per-provider fields + a
      migration), #481 (a key sent in cleartext to a **non-loopback** `http://` host — but plain-http
      *loopback* is the intended local-inference design, so "require https" is not the fix), #482 (a hanging
      endpoint may wedge the single-thread `ai-service` executor for the session — **unverified**, reasoned).
      **Verified clean, with what was run:** the request body carries only the system prompt + language + the
      `prefix<CURSOR>suffix` window (explain/rewrite send `getSelectedText()`, **not** the buffer; no file path
      or name is transmitted; `AiRequests.truncate` caps at 120k); `aiEnabled`+`aiSupport`+`!simpleMode` are
      ANDed consistently in both coordinators; SSE `[DONE]`/empty-`data:`/`MissingNode` handled (a real stream
      parsed end-to-end through the fake server); `AiService`'s generation guard is double-checked and
      `rewriteSelection` re-verifies the text at `[start,end)` before replacing; the ACP agent is
      `ProcessRegistry.track`ed + `killTree`d and **drains stderr past the log cap** (the LSP/DAP deadlock,
      correctly avoided); every `AcpClient.Host` callback marshals via `Platform.runLater`, no `.get()`/
      `.join()` on FX. **Repro NOT pursued:** ACP `fs/read_text_file` has no path confinement, but the agent is
      a local process the user launched with their own privileges and can read those files directly — defence
      in depth, not a privilege boundary.
- [x] Editor-preview audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 4 fixes across the **N-parallel-implementations** cluster,
      driven against **real oracles**: croniter (a venv under the scratchpad), Python's `csv`, and `ssh -G`.
      **The two halves of the audit met in the middle:** a differential test of `CronExpression.nextRuns` vs
      croniter over 21 expressions found **0 disagreements** — the engine is exact, including the Vixie
      day-of-month/day-of-week **OR-rule** — while a *self*-consistency check of `describe()` against
      `nextRuns()` found the **English says the opposite**. `dayPhrase()` joined the two day parts with
      **" and "** (`0 0 13 * 5` → "day 13 of the month and on Friday" = Friday the 13th; it fires every Friday
      *and* every 13th), and gated on `coversAll()` while `matches()` gates on `isStar()` — so `0 0 1-31 * 5`
      dropped the field that forces the OR and claimed "on Friday" while firing **daily**. `CrontabPreview`
      renders both in one row, so it contradicted itself on screen. Both now derive from `isStar()` + " or ".
      Also **`0 0 * * 6-7` — the canonical weekend cron — was a "syntax error"**: `CronField.value` folded
      7→Sunday-0 *before* the range bound was read, making `lo=6, hi=0`; Vixie expands over 0-7 and folds
      after, so `parse` now uses `parseMax = max+1` for DOW and normalizes 7→0 once every range is expanded.
      And the shared seam: every `set*PreviewEnabled` asked **"is this file my format?"** instead of **"does
      this file still have a preview?"**, wrong in both directions — XML's tree rides `structuredPreview` but
      `isStructured()` is false for XML, so turning it off **stranded** the buffer in PREVIEW where every
      `scheduleRenderPreview` branch misses and falls through to the **unconditional Markdown tail** (it renders
      the XML source as Markdown) with `hasPreview()`=false removing the toggle needed to escape; conversely a
      workflow *is* YAML, so turning off structured **evicted** it from the GH-Actions preview and clobbered a
      view mode persisted per file. One `reconcilePreviewMode()` (= the `!hasPreview()` test the GH-Actions
      sibling alone already had) now serves all 9 setters. Deferred → #476 (the ssh-config preview claims
      options an earlier `Host *` overrides — `ssh -G` proves 2 of 3 values wrong; needs a real resolver +
      pattern matching), #477 (sparse cron shows 1 of 3 next runs — the ~4-year scan budget is shared across
      all n), #478 (CR-only line endings are one long line everywhere, not just in the CSV grid).
      **Verified clean, with what was run:** `CsvParser.formatRow`→`parse` round-trip over 11 nasty values
      (commas/quotes/`""`/embedded newlines/CRLF) — 0 failures; `CsvParser.parse` vs Python `csv` over 25
      inputs — 22 identical, 2 cosmetic blank-line diffs, 1 = #478; `CsvAlign` align/shrink properties — 27/27;
      `StructuredParser`/`XmlParser` caps — a 200k-node doc errors cleanly in ~85 ms building **zero** nodes,
      20k-deep nesting is refused (no `StackOverflowError`); impossible cron (`0 0 31 2 *`) terminates in 30 ms;
      `looksLikeWorkflow` — 11 cases incl. the YAML-1.1 `"on"`→boolean gotcha, nested/commented keys, and a
      bounded 64 KB head read; `previewGen` + FX-thread discipline identical across all 8 tree branches;
      `isXml()` excludes `.svg`. **Repros that FAILED:** `*/2` needing Vixie's `DOM_STAR` (croniter agrees with
      us); `CsvAlign` losing quoted content; unbounded node building; `isGithubActions()` costing a full
      `getText()`.
- [x] Debug/DAP audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 5 fixes, verified against **real debugpy 1.8.21 + node 22**.
      **Data loss first:** `BreakpointManager`/`BookmarkManager.reanchor` rebuild a **line-keyed map**, so two
      markers resolving to the same line meant `put` silently dropped one — and `restore`'s self-heal then
      **persisted** the loss. Trivial to hit: two breakpoints on **adjacent identical lines** (`});`/`});`) plus
      any external edit that shifts them — the upper one re-anchors down onto the line the lower one still
      exact-matches. Both lines still exist; one marker (and, for a bookmark, its **note**) is gone for good.
      The javadoc *documented* it as a feature ("Collisions dedup naturally via the map (last writer wins)") —
      but these aren't duplicates. Now each resolves against the lines still **free**, walked in stored-line
      order so the outcome can't depend on the caller's ordering (a persisted bookmark list is in *user* order).
      Also: **Java debug launches corrupted quoted program args** — `String.join(" ", args)` undid the very
      tokenization `ProgramArgs.tokenize` performed, so `"hello world" second` reached `main()` as **3** args
      while Run passed 2 (the collision `[hello world, second]` vs `[hello, world, second]` → one identical
      string proves the loss is irrecoverable at our boundary); python/js's `program(...)` sibling 25 lines below
      was always correct. **`debug.toggleExceptionBreakpoints` silently did nothing mid-session** while echoing
      success — `exceptionFilters` is read *only* by `initialized()`, so `DapManager`'s `if (client != null)`
      live branch wrote a field nothing would read again (proven against real debugpy: filters set up front →
      stops on the exception; toggled mid-session → runs straight through and terminates). And the
      **execution-line highlight painted the wrong file**: `highlightFrame` took `host.activeBuffer()` after an
      `openPath` that opens nothing when the frame's source isn't on disk (a dependency, or a CI-baked path) —
      and `setExecutionLine` also `jumpToLine`s, so it yanked the caret of the file you were reading to an
      arbitrary line; its sibling `applyInlineValues` already used `bufferForPath` correctly.
      **Shipped a feature that was 95% built:** logpoints + disabled breakpoints persisted, re-anchored, reached
      the adapter, and had gutter glyphs — but `setLogMessage`/`setEnabled` had **zero callers**, so both states
      were unreachable and `command.debug.editBreakpoint.desc` ("condition, log message") was a lie; Edit
      Breakpoint is now a 3-field form. Deferred → #473 (a breakpoint in a **closed** file is saved and shown
      again on reopen but never sent to the adapter — `collectBreakpoints` walks open buffers only), #474
      (Editora's own installed js-debug always loses to a VS Code copy — "newest wins" scrapes a version from
      the path and Editora's layout has none). Verified-clean / **repros that FAILED**: breakpoints wiped by a
      restore-before-load (`loadInto` is synchronous and precedes it on both open paths); watches leaking across
      projects (`setWorkspaceStateFile` precedes `init`); a stale `variablesReference` after resume (expanding
      one yields an empty node — cosmetic). Also **measured, not guessed**: persisting on every line-changing
      edit costs **0.215 ms** on a 49 KB store — ~0.6% of the FX thread while holding Enter, so it stays.
      Conditional breakpoints, run-to-cursor temp cleanup, adapter kill-on-dispose (`alive after dispose? false`),
      threading (no blocking call on FX; the `initialized` reader-thread deadlock genuinely avoided), and the
      jdtls bundle→restart ordering (now that #472 made `shutdownServer` work) all verified end to end.
- [x] LSP audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 4 fixes, driven against the **11 real servers installed here**.
      **The root cause was a raw NUL byte typed into the source.** `LspManager`'s session key was
      `serverId + "<NUL>" + root.toUri()` — a literal control character, not an escape — which made the whole
      file **binary to grep/rg** (they skip it silently; my own greps returned nothing, and the audit agent
      misread the key as `serverId + " " + root`). Under that cover, `shutdownServer` built its scan prefix as
      `serverId + " "` — **a space** — so `key.startsWith(prefix)` never matched and **`shutdownServer` was a
      complete no-op**. Its callers: disabling a server in Settings (the server kept running), and
      `restartServer` — i.e. *"toggling debug **restarts jdtls** so it reloads with the java-debug bundle"*
      (CLAUDE.md) never happened, so Java debugging silently didn't work until an app restart. Now one
      `SESSION_KEY_SEP` + `sessionKey`/`sessionKeyPrefix`, unit-tested against each other. Also: **a hung
      `initialize` had no timeout** and the pending queue was unbounded and never cleared on failure/dispose —
      each queued `didChange` captures the whole document, so ~1000 queued edits of a 1 MB file retained ~1 GB
      against `-Xmx2g`, with the loading bar spinning forever (measured by the audit); now `orTimeout` +
      `didChange` collapsing per uri + clear on every exit path. **A server that dies on its own was never
      detected** — the session stayed cached with `initialized=true`, so `isManaged()` kept the re-open guard
      shut and every request failed into an empty result while the status bar still named the server (now
      `process.onExit()` → drop from both maps). And **changing a server's command never applied**: the session
      key omits the command and `putCommand` only invalidated the detect cache, so the stale session was handed
      straight back and the old process leaked. Deferred → #468 (JSON/CSS/HTML advertise
      `documentFormattingProvider:false` but *do* format — needs `provideFormatter`), #469 (disabling a server
      strands its diagnostics), #470 (Problems' active-file sort vs symlinked paths), #471 (Find References is
      O(refs × document) on the FX thread). Verified-clean / **repros that FAILED**: two windows sharing one
      jdtls `-data` (both real jdtls initialized fine — the `.lock` wedge did not reproduce); `applyLspEdits`
      clamping a whole-document edit (drove taplo both with and without a trailing newline — both round-trip).
      **Hypothesis disproved:** Editora never declares `textDocument.formatting`/`documentSymbol` client caps,
      but an A/B of all 11 servers with Editora's real `initialize` vs a fully-declaring client showed **zero**
      difference in advertised providers. Clean: `LspPositions` (UTF-16 units), `SemanticTokensDecoder`,
      `DiagnosticMapper`/`DocumentSymbolMapper`, overlay clamping, didOpen/didChange pairing + monotonic
      versions, `whenReady` ordering, the stderr drain, `dispose()` → `killTree`.
- [x] Typst + MCP audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 9 fixes incl. one **security** issue, verified against real
      typst 0.15.0 and a real `McpServer` probed over loopback. **SECURITY: `mcp-endpoint.json` was written at
      the umask (0644) into a 0755 config dir** — and that bearer token is the *only* boundary on a tool
      surface that runs **any** registered command and reads/writes **any** path (both verified live against a
      running server). On macOS every standard account's primary group is `staff`, so `~` at 0750 doesn't stop
      another local user; on Linux `/home/user` is commonly 0755. Now 0600 + the dir 0700 (the codebase already
      writes secrets 0600 elsewhere), and `authorized()` uses `MessageDigest.isEqual` instead of
      `String.equals`. **The bigger lesson: Typst repeated the #460 Mermaid/Diagram bugs verbatim** — my own PR
      fixed the diagram siblings and left the third parallel implementation untouched: cached failures with no
      TTL and no `configure()` invalidation (so Install… → `reapplyToolSupport` → `refreshPreview` was a cache
      HIT on the stale "typst not found" — `InstallCoordinator`'s comment literally promises "→ preview lights
      up"), `command()` whitespace-splitting a Browse'd/installer-written path with a space, and `detect()`'s
      `exit != -1` false-positiving an npx wrapper. Plus Typst-only: the cache key omitted `fileDir`/`root`
      although `#import`/`#image` resolve **relative to them** (two projects' identical boilerplate `main.typ`
      served each other's render; editing an imported `conf.typ` never refreshed); export named the chooser's
      path though typst rewrites `report.png`→`report-1.png` **even for one page** (new `exportedFiles()`
      globs what was really written, and "exited 0, wrote nothing" is now a failure — the #460 lesson);
      `TypstMarkup.continuation` threw `NumberFormatException` out of the **Enter key filter** on a 20-digit
      list number (the Markdown sibling guards this *and says why in a comment*; the copy dropped it). MCP
      also: a JSON-RPC batch was answered 202-with-no-body (the client waits forever) → `INVALID_REQUEST`; the
      request body is capped. Deferred → #461 (preview cache bounds documents not pages — a 40-page doc
      retains ~570 MB vs `-Xmx2g`), #462 (compile errors show the UUID temp filename), #463 (closing the owner
      window stops MCP app-wide), #464 (stale endpoint file survives a crash), #465 (the throwaway `.typ` may
      trigger project-tree refreshes — repro FAILED on macOS, would fire on Linux inotify). Verified-clean by
      execution: MCP binds **strictly loopback** (a LAN POST is refused), the auth gate (401/405, no CORS on
      preflight so a browser cannot attach the token — DNS-rebinding gets same-origin but still can't guess
      it), malformed JSON → clean -32700 with no leak; typst's `page-{p}.png` naming is correct for single
      *and* multi page (no PlantUML-style surprise), the `-{p}` template is *required* (typst hard-errors
      without it), relative `#import`/`#image` + `--root` containment genuinely work, temp cleanup on
      success/failure/bad-exe.
- [x] Mermaid + Diagrams audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 8 fixes, verified against the **real CLIs installed on
      this box** (mmdc 11.16.0, graphviz 15.1.0, plantuml 1.2026.6, maid via npx). Headline: **PlantUML names
      its output after the DIAGRAM, not the input** — `@startuml myclassdiagram` writes `myclassdiagram.png`,
      but `DiagramRenderer` read back a fixed `diagram.<fmt>`, so (a) a valid named diagram rendered as bare
      `"render failed"` (identical to a broken one, since a successful plantuml run has empty stderr → the
      `Render.fail` blank branch) and (b) **export reported success while writing NO file** — `exportTo` only
      moved `if (r.ok() && isRegularFile(out))` but returned `r` regardless, and the temp dir was then deleted
      in `finally`. Now `producedFile()` finds what the tool actually wrote (the temp dir is single-use), and a
      missing output is an error. The `DiagramKind.PLANTUML` javadoc asserted the wrong assumption verbatim.
      Also: **render failures were cached forever** keyed on `sha256(source+theme)` — never the tool — and
      `configure()` never invalidated, so Install… → `reapplyToolSupport` → `refreshPreview` was a cache HIT on
      the stale error (fixed: `configure` clears on a tool/enabled change + a `FAILURE_TTL_MS` like
      `PreviewImageLoader`, which these classes "mirror" but had no TTL); **`detect`'s `exit != -1` rule
      false-positives for an npx wrapper** (npx always launches → maid "detected" on any machine with Node →
      live lint fired a ~6.5 s npx per pause; now a multi-token command requires exit 0); `command()`
      whitespace-split a Browse…-picked path with a space (now: an existing file is one token, else
      quote-aware `ProgramArgs.tokenize`); `setPaths` nulled the availability cache **unconditionally**, so
      every live-apply settings/theme change re-probed (~6.5 s) on the single thread shared with lint+export;
      `diagnose()` spawned maid on **every** failed render with no availability gate (5 fences, no mmdc → ~30 s
      of npx); `MaidOutput.collect` never read maid's real top-level **`warnings`** array. Deferred → #458
      (no cancellation of superseded renders — typing in a `.mmd` queues ~4 s Chromium spawns), #459
      (multi-`@startuml` renders only the first, silently). Verified-clean by execution: temp-file cleanup on
      success/failure/missing-binary (0 leaks), temp dirs are 0700, **no** concurrent-render collision (each
      render gets its own temp dir — the audit's own hypothesis, disproved), no argv injection (source always
      via temp file), `MaidOutput` vs real maid JSON, the lint overlay's out-of-range clamping, mmdc/dot flags
      vs the installed versions, LRU bounding, the DiagramImages theme-bit omission.
- [x] External Tools audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 8 fixes, two of them in the **shared** `ProcessRunner`:
      **the timeout was unenforceable** (stdout was drained *inline* on the caller, and `waitFor(timeout)` only
      ran after that drain hit EOF — which needs the child to exit; measured: `sleep 5` with a 1 s timeout
      returned at **5011 ms, exit=0**) and **stdin was never closed when `stdin == null`**, so anything that
      reads stdin (`grep`/`jq`/`sort`, an easy misconfiguration since StdinSource defaults to NONE) blocked
      forever → never closed stdout → the inline drain never returned → the single-thread
      `ExternalToolService` executor was **dead for the session** (verified: still hung at 8 s; now exits
      immediately). Both drains moved to side threads + `ProcessRegistry.killTree` on timeout + a 10 MB capture
      cap (a runaway `find /` could OOM the service thread, and `exec.submit` discards the Future so the Error
      vanished and the status spun forever — now also `catch (Throwable)`). **This affects every subprocess in
      the app** (git/mermaid/build tools/LSP+DAP detection/elevated save), all of which had an unenforceable
      timeout. Plus, in External Tools proper: **`applyResult` wrote stdout into `host.activeBuffer()` at
      *apply* time** — switch tabs during a 600 ms `black -` run and REPLACE_BUFFER overwrote an unrelated file
      wholesale, reporting success (now captures the target + its `docVersion`, the `requestLspCompletion`
      idiom); **`tokenize(expand(x))` tokenized user data** (`$FilePath$` = `~/My Docs/a.txt` → 2 argv;
      `'$FilePath$'` still broke on `~/Bob's Files/` *and* ate the apostrophe; an empty `$SelectedText$`
      vanished, shifting positionals → `grep file.txt` treated the file as the pattern and hung) — now the
      template is tokenized first and macros expand **per token** (IntelliJ's model, one macro = one argv);
      `rerunLast` held the `ExternalTool` instance so it re-ran deleted/disabled tools and pre-edit commands
      (now by name, re-resolved, + an `isEnabled()` guard in `run`); the Settings page snapshotted the tool
      list **in the constructor**, so a second window's save deleted the first's new tools (now reloads in
      `load()`); the `slug` was copied from `MacroService` **without its `slugClash` guard** (two tools → one
      `externalTool.run.<id>`, last-write-wins, one silently unreachable + its keybinding stolen); and a
      successful run with empty stdout reported `"<tool> failed: "` with a blank reason. Verified-clean:
      `ToolMacros.expand` (single-pass — no recursive re-expansion, `$$`, unknown `$X$`, null fields), the
      remote/SFTP gate (#426 shape — genuinely closed), the stdin writer thread (8 MB in 10 ms, broken pipe
      swallowed), `stripOneTrailingNewline` (exactly one, not applied to REPLACE_BUFFER), Simple-mode gating,
      the `externalTool.run.` prefix vs the static picker id.
- [x] Workspace audit (per-feature bug hunt: Projects / Notes / Local History / update check) — 6 fixes, all
      data-loss or intent-loss: **`PathKeys.findKeyByIdentity` accepted a `CONTENT_HASH` match as file
      identity**, so opening any file with identical bytes (a `cp`, a duplicated LICENSE, a monorepo's
      boilerplate `index.ts`) ran the rename re-key — `map.remove(keyA)` + `put(keyB)` + persist — **deleting
      the original's notes** (now gated on the candidate's file being *gone* from disk, which is what a rename
      actually is; verified both ways: rename still re-keys, copy no longer steals); **`HistoryRetention`
      pruned user-labelled revisions** (age *and* the per-file cap *and* the project budget — with autosave on,
      50 automatic revisions is hours, so a "before-refactor" label could die the same day; new `isProtected`
      exempts labels + the pre-delete capture); **`recordFor` was a read-modify-write across the async
      boundary** (the executor built the new list from the list as it was at *submit* time → two records for
      one key, or an autosave of two dirty buffers, dropped a revision / resurrected budget-evicted rows —
      `HistoryService.snapshot` now delivers just the `HistoryRevision` and `applyRecorded` folds it in on FX
      against the live list); **blob GC ran from a per-record callback** with an FX-snapshotted `liveHashes`,
      so a blob written but not yet indexed was deleted → an index row whose content is gone, rendered as an
      empty file *and* apply-able over the real one (now gated on an FX-confined `recordsInFlight == 0`);
      **`NoteManager.place` laundered RESOLVED → ORPHANED → ACTIVE** (a system observation overwrote a user
      decision, persisted); and **`compareVersions` ranked `1.0.0-rc1` above `1.0.0`** (raw last-segment string
      compare — `"0"` < `"0-rc1"`), so RC users never saw the GA (proper semver pre-release precedence now;
      shared with the plugin registry). Deferred → #453 (LINE notes capture no context → nearest-identical-line
      re-anchor), #454 (a >200-char note highlights only 200 — needs a `TextAnchor` schema bump), #455
      (>5000 occurrences → jumps up-file instead of orphaning). Verified-clean: `ProjectManager` (active/delete/
      `createOrGet` by normalized root), `WindowManager.reconcileOpenSet` (3 s debounce; traced the quit burst),
      `deleteProject` (right id; orphan blobs reclaimed by the next gc), `NoteAnchors.shiftOffset/shiftRange`,
      `NoteStore.mergePreservingOrder` (by UUID), the pre-delete capture, restore targeting (folder mode can't
      revert another file), `HistoryBlobStore` (temp+move, sharded, idempotent), index write atomicity,
      `UpdateCheck.isDue` (clock moved back = due) + `parseLatest` caps/HTTPS/UA.
- [x] Build Tools audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 7 fixes across the Maven/npm/Cargo/Go/Gradle framework:
      **`GradleTasks.parse` required `" - description"`**, so `gradle tasks --all` rows for
      description-less tasks were silently dropped (verified against **real Gradle 9.5.1 output**: 30→32 tasks;
      `noDescriptionTask`/`prepareKotlinBuildScriptModel` were lost while the status echoed the undercount as
      success) — now a whole-line name match, with bare section headers ("Rules", "Other tasks") excluded by
      the `-----` rule Gradle underlines them with; **`BuildTool.GRADLE.parse` builds a fresh
      `GradleActionsProvider` per detect** and detect re-runs on tab switch/focus/**every save**, so the ~90 s
      task enumeration was wiped by Ctrl+S (the coordinator now caches `loadedTasks` per root and re-applies in
      `applyDetected`); **`loadAllTasks` had no generation guard** (unlike `refresh()`) → switching projects
      mid-load merged project A's tasks into project B's tree; **the wrapper probe used `isRegularFile`, never
      `isExecutable`** → a non-+x `mvnw` (Windows clone / unzip; Maven's docs say `chmod +x mvnw`) won the
      preference and every build died `error=13 Permission denied` instead of falling back to `mvn`, and the
      **Windows wrapper was launched by bare name** (`mvnw.cmd` is neither on PATH nor resolved against the
      child's CWD → now absolute); **only `bun.lockb` was probed** so Bun ≥1.2's default `bun.lock` ran `npm`;
      a **malformed marker** showed "No build tool detected" in the tree (the stripe is visible *because* the
      marker exists — now shows `status.build.malformed`); and `runCustom` re-read `markerRoot` inside its
      prompt callback (NPE if the pom vanished meanwhile). Deferred → #451 (`RootResolver` accepts a
      *directory* named like a marker; shared with LSP, which needs the directory arm for `.terraform`/`.git`).
      Verified-clean: **no shell injection** via a parsed npm script / Maven profile id (pure `ProcessBuilder`
      argv, plus JDK≥21.0.3's `.cmd` arg validation); `BuildService.stop()` **does** tree-kill (the LSP orphan
      bug is not repeated); daemon stdout+stderr pumps; `refresh()`'s generation guard; `BuildOutputPanel`
      owner-routing (IdentityHashMap → no cross-tab interleave, tabs not user-closable mid-build); the
      stale-toggle drop + `sections.equals(rendered)` no-op; PomParser XXE + partial-pom tolerance;
      CargoProject virtual workspace; GoProject `go.work`; remote/SFTP gating.
- [x] TODO-highlighting audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 7 fixes, the top three in the code that **rewrites the
      user's source line**: `TodoComment.parse` swept a **block-comment terminator** into the description, so
      `withDescription` on a `/*  TODO: x  */` line emitted it back without the closer — an unterminated
      comment silently commenting out the rest of the file (new shared `TodoComment.closerStart`, honored by
      `parse` *and* re-appended by `TodoEdit.rebuild`; covers `*/` + `-->`); a **Markdown link**
      `[label](url)` after the keyword parsed as a `[tag]`, and the canonical re-emit injected a space that
      broke it (a `]` followed by `(` is never a tag now) — this fires on a plain "Mark Done" in a TODO.md;
      and **Reopen hardcoded "TODO"**, silently downgrading every FIXME/HACK/XXX ever marked done (mark-done
      destroys the keyword, so Reopen is now a submenu of the configured keywords, pushed from
      `applyHighlight`). Plus: `applyTodoLineEdit` returned bare on a read-only buffer (no status, no
      re-scan → looked broken; new `status.todo.readOnly` ×6) and on an out-of-range line; `todo.addPattern`
      quick-added with `caseSensitive=false` while every `defaults()` entry uses true; `jumpTodoMark`
      bypassed the `todoEnabled`/`largeFile` gates (a full FX-thread scan of a file showing no marks); and
      `TodoHighlightOverlay.redraw` wrapped the *whole* mark loop in one try/catch, so one stale
      out-of-range mark blanked every highlight for the frame (now per-mark + a length clamp).
      **Not reproducible — dropped:** the audit flagged user-regex ReDoS on the FX thread as CONFIRMED, but
      JDK 25's engine defeated every textbook pattern tried (`(x+x+)+y`, `(a+)+$`, `(a|aa)+$`,
      `([a-zA-Z]+)*$` — all sub-millisecond, raw `Pattern` too); `(.*a){25}` costs a flat ~300 ms whatever the
      input length, i.e. JIT warmup, not backtracking. Verified-clean: TodoScanner zero-length/CRLF/col
      round-trip/document order, TodoComment bounds, TodoPatterns.compile, TodoGrouping comparators,
      TodoService caps + generation guard, the stale-snapshot check, canvas discipline.
- [x] Macros audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 7 fixes, two of them core: **Backspace/Delete/arrows/Home/End
      were invisible to the recorder** (the area handles them natively, *no* bundled keymap binds them, and
      `isRecordableChar` rejects 0x08 — so neither hook saw them and `x Backspace y` replayed as `xy`; new
      `MacroStep.KEY` kind + the pure `MacroKey` codec (`S-DOWN`/`C-LEFT` carry modifiers, since the area acts
      on those too) + `KeyDispatcher.setKeyListener` at the unbound-key fall-through + `EditorBuffer.pressKey`
      re-dispatching a real event so the Backspace filters run); and **both capture hooks were scene-wide**
      (they are scene filters → they saw the palette's/find bar's own typing, recorded it as TEXT, and replay
      typed it into the document — new `setRecordTarget` gate + `EditorBuffer.ownsKeyTarget`). Plus:
      `onCommand`'s `macro.` prefix also swallowed `macro.run.*` (macro composition silently dropped —
      recursion is the player guard's job, not the recorder's); a rename keeping the slug (`build`→`Build`)
      **destroyed the keybinding** (`reset(oldId)` ran after `rebind(newId)` on the *same* id — now
      id-compared and reset-before-rebind); **slug collisions** (`my macro`/`my-macro`, any symbol-only name →
      `macro`) registered one `macro.run.<id>` twice, last-write-wins, shadowing a macro (now refused via
      `MacroService.slugClash` + `settings.macro.idExists`); `replayLastN` took an unbounded count (FX-thread
      freeze → `MAX_REPLAY_TIMES`); `run()` reported success for a replay the re-entrancy guard had dropped
      (`play` returns a boolean now); `runSaved` did not finalize an in-progress recording. Deferred → #449
      (nested-command record order, latent). Verified-clean: the `playing` guard's `finally`, replay never
      re-recorded, no assist double-application, persistence, multi-window broadcast, recorder lifecycle.
- [x] Markdown audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 7 fixes: **`MarkdownTable.blockBounds` threw at caret 0 of a
      doc starting with `\n`** (the `Math.max(0, caret-1)` clamp made `lastIndexOf` find the leading newline →
      `substring(1,0)`; it runs on *every* Enter/Tab in a Markdown buffer, so the keystroke was swallowed);
      **`splitCells` split on `\|`** (escaped pipes are content — `fromCsv` emits them by design, so a
      CSV-pasted table was corrupted by the next Tab; cells are now held unescaped internally, re-escaped on
      emit via `escapePipes`, widths measured on the escaped form, and `cellIndexAt`/`cellContentOffset` skip
      escaped pipes); **`OdtWriter.esc` passed C0 control chars into `content.xml`** (XML 1.0 forbids them
      even as numeric refs → an unopenable `.odt`; new `stripInvalidXml`, matching what POI already does for
      docx); **italic-over-bold unwrapped the bold** (`*` matched the inner asterisk of `**` → `*bold*`, not
      `***bold***`; new `partOfLongerRun` guard); **MD009 flagged hard line breaks** (2 trailing spaces =
      `<br>`, allowed by upstream's `br_spaces: 2` default — the fixer was deleting them; new
      `MarkdownLint.isHardLineBreak`, shared with `MarkdownLintFix`); **`---` under a list item read as a
      setext heading** (it's a thematic break per CommonMark; new `isParagraphStart` guard — it was polluting
      the Structure outline and generated TOCs); and **`deleteRow` parked the caret on the delimiter row**.
      Verified-clean: `MarkdownToc.slug`/`uniqueAnchor` (GitHub-compatible incl. CJK + the `-1`/`-2` counter),
      `parseSize` bounds, ragged-table add/delete column, `MarkdownLines` ordered-list continuation, MathSpans
      currency rejection, DocxWriter (POI sanitizes), lint directives, `MarkdownLintFix` idempotence.
- [x] Completion audit (per-feature bug hunt) — 7 fixes: **42 bundled snippets were unreachable by keyboard**
      (Tab-expansion scanned only `[A-Za-z0-9_]`, so `#inc`/`!`/`?xml`/`---`/`->` never matched; it now tries
      the whole non-whitespace token first, falling back to the identifier run); **the post-accept suppression
      never fired** (a boolean cleared in `Platform.runLater` ≈264 ms before the 280 ms debounce it gated —
      now stamped against a new `EditorBuffer.docVersion`, so it lasts exactly until the user's next edit);
      **ghost text spliced casings** (`APP` + `le` = `APPle` — `CompletionEngine.ghostSuffix` now accepts only
      a word cased like what was typed); **`rankCompare` violated the `Comparator` contract** (the "very close
      match" nudge read only operand `a` → non-antisymmetric, input-order-dependent ranking, plus a latent
      TimSort `IllegalArgumentException`); **`MatchHighlighter` indexed a lowercased copy** (`toLowerCase`
      isn't length-preserving — "İ" → 2 chars — so ranges drifted and could overrun the label the popup cell
      substrings); and **two async staleness gaps** (auto-import `additionalTextEdits` applied blind after the
      resolve round-trip; the LSP completion guard trusted caret equality, which an edit can restore).
      Deferred: honoring an LSP item's own `textEdit.range` on accept (a server whose trigger char is part of
      its insert text — phpactor's `$` — yields `$$user`), and offering non-identifier snippet prefixes in the
      *popup* (needs a per-item replace range).
- [x] Update notifications — checks GitHub `/releases/latest` on startup (once/day, throttled via
      `Settings.lastUpdateCheckEpoch`), gated by `Settings.updateCheck` (default on). Pure `update/UpdateCheck`
      (parseLatest / normalizeVersion / isNewer via `PluginInstaller.compareVersions` / isDue) + `update/UpdateService`
      (daemon HTTPS GET reusing `PluginRegistry.readCapped`/`isHttps`, `Platform.runLater` Outcome). Surfaces:
      a status-bar "Update: X.Y.Z" segment (`update.openDownloadPage` opens the release page + dismisses the
      version via `Settings.dismissedUpdateVersion`), an About-dialog "Update available" link, and the manual
      `help.checkForUpdates` command; `view.toggleUpdateCheck` + Settings → Workspace → Updates. Drafts/prereleases
      ignored. `AppInfo.GITHUB_REPO`/`LATEST_RELEASE_API`/`RELEASES_PAGE`. Schema 76→77 (additive ×3). i18n ×6.
      Covered by `UpdateCheckTest` (pure) + `UpdateNoticeFxTest` (segment/dismiss/commands, real window).
- [x] Consolidated the five build-tool output consoles into one shared tabbed **Build Output** window — Maven/
      npm/Cargo/Go/Gradle previously each registered a separate console tool window (5 stripe buttons + 5
      Settings → Tool Windows rows); now one `BuildOutputPanel` (a `TabPane`, id `buildOutput`, `Icons::terminal`)
      owned by `MainController`, with one `BuildToolPanel` tab per tool created on first run (owner-routed:
      `started(owner, toolName, …)` makes/selects the tab, `appendOutput/finished/failed` route to that tool's
      console — two concurrent builds get their own tabs, no interleaving). Removed the per-tool `tool.<id>Output`
      commands + `buildConsoleWindows` map; added `tool.buildOutput`; repurposed `toolwindow.buildOutput` i18n to
      a plain "Build Output" (×6). The per-tool **tasks** windows are unchanged. Covered by `BuildOutputPanelFxTest`
      (tab routing) + `BuildOutputWindowFxTest` (window-level) + `BuildCoordinatorFxTest` (shared-panel ctor).
- [x] Copy/cut current line on empty selection (VS Code `editor.emptySelectionClipboard`) — with no
      selection, `edit.copy`/`edit.cut` act on the whole current line (Cut is one undoable step; last-line cut
      takes the preceding newline so no blank line is left). `EditorBuffer.copyCurrentLine`/`cutCurrentLine`;
      gated by `Settings.copyLineWhenNoSelection` (default on, schema 75→76); Settings → Editor checkbox +
      palette `view.toggleCopyLineWhenNoSelection`; i18n ×6; covered by `CopyLineNoSelectionFxTest`.
- [x] Expert mode — a per-window focus mode like Zen but lighter: it strips only the surrounding window
      chrome (toolbar/tab bar/breadcrumb/tool stripes + whitespace guides) and keeps the whole editor view
      (line numbers, status bar, minimap, column ruler, current-line highlight). Mirrors Zen end-to-end:
      `WorkspaceState.expertMode` (+ `preExpertToolWindows`), a floating "E" exit button (`Icons.expert()`,
      `.expert-exit`), command `view.toggleExpert` (`C-c C-e`), a Settings → Interface → Modes checkbox, and
      i18n ×6. `Chrome` gained a `focusMode` (= zen || expert) param for the items both hide (toolbar/tab
      bar/breadcrumb/tool stripes/whitespace), while `statusBar`/`lineNumbers`/`columnRuler`/`lineHighlight`/
      `minimap` stay keyed on the real `zen` flag so Expert keeps them; the two modes are mutually exclusive.
      Covered by `ChromeTest` (the truth table) + a new `ExpertModeFxTest`. A `--expert` launch flag (mirroring
      `--zen`) threads through `WindowManager.launch`/`buildWindow` → `MainController.startup`.
- [x] Build tools → IntelliJ-style tasks tool windows — replaced the per-tool main-toolbar icons with a
      dedicated tool-window stripe per build tool (Maven/npm/Cargo/Go/Gradle), shown when the marker file is
      detected. New `ui/BuildActionsTree` (a `ToolWindowContent`: a mini icon toolbar — Run/Reload/Stop/Run
      custom…, plus Gradle's "Load all tasks…" — over a `TreeView` of the provider's sections; task leaves run
      on double-click/Enter, toggle leaves re-query the provider). The streaming output moved to a separate
      per-tool console window (`tool.<tool>Output`, auto-opens on a run); `tool.<tool>` now opens the tasks
      window. The searchable actions popup is kept for the palette (`<tool>.showActions`), now shown centered
      (no toolbar anchor). Removed `setupBuildToolButtons`/the FXML `buildToolsSeparator`. No framework change
      (still `BuildTool`/`BuildActionsProvider`/`BuildService`); new `buildtree.*` + `toolwindow.buildOutput`
      i18n. *Deferred: run/debug configurations, richer per-section grouping (e.g. Maven Dependencies).*
- [x] GitHub Actions workflow preview — a workflow YAML (detected by content: top-level `on:` + `jobs:`)
      renders a plain-English digest instead of the generic YAML tree: triggers (with a `schedule:` cron
      decoded via the cron engine), then each job's runner/needs/if + ordered steps. Pure `ghactions/`
      core (`GithubActions` sniff + `Workflow` parser, reusing the existing YAML + cron support);
      `editor/GithubActionsPreview` renders into the shared self-scrolling tree host (its branch precedes
      the structured YAML branch so it wins; off → YAML tree). On by default; `Settings.githubActionsPreview`
      (schema 74→75). No new dependency. *Deferred: a workflow⇄YAML-tree toggle, composite `action.yml`,
      docker-compose / k8s YAML dialects next.*
- [x] systemd / SSH-config / Dockerfile previews — three more config-file 3-mode previews that decode into
      English. **systemd** (`.service`/`.timer`/…): per-directive glosses + a `.timer`'s `OnCalendar=`
      decoded to English + next run times (shorthands + `On*Sec=` monotonic timers via time-span decode);
      pure `systemd/` core (`SystemdUnit`/`SystemdCalendar`/`TimeSpan`/`SystemdDescribe`). **SSH config**: a
      per-`Host` connection summary + option glosses; pure `sshconfig/` core. **Dockerfile**: a per-stage
      digest (base image, ports, workdir, user, entrypoint/cmd, healthcheck, step count); pure `dockerfile/`
      core. All render into the shared self-scrolling tree host; snapshot Export-to-PDF/Print for free. On
      by default; `Settings.systemdPreview`/`sshConfigPreview`/`dockerfilePreview` (schema 73→74). No new
      dependency. *Deferred: systemd second-granularity next-runs + `.network`/`.link` specifics, ssh
      `Match` criteria eval + Include resolution, Dockerfile ARG-substitution in image names.*
- [x] fstab mount preview — an `/etc/fstab` file (already syntax-highlighted) gets the 3-mode preview: each
      line decoded into English (device spec — UUID/LABEL/path/CIFS/NFS —, mount point, filesystem, the
      comma-separated options, and the fsck/dump columns); a malformed line (too few columns, non-numeric
      dump/pass) turns red. Pure `fstab/` core (`Fstab` parser + `FstabDescribe` option dictionary),
      unit-tested; `editor/FstabPreview` renders into the shared self-scrolling tree host; snapshot
      Export-to-PDF/Print for free. On by default; `Settings.fstabPreview` (schema 67→68). No new
      dependency. *Deferred: btrfs subvolume tree, per-option man-page links, a mount-vs-running-mounts diff.*
- [x] Crontab schedule preview — a `crontab`/`*.cron`/`cron.d/*` file (already syntax-highlighted) gets the
      3-mode preview: each schedule decoded into English (`30 2 * * 1-5` → "At 02:30, Monday through
      Friday"), the next fire times, `@reboot`/`@daily`/… macros, and a red field-error for a malformed
      line. Pure `cron/` core (`CronExpression` with the Vixie DOM/DOW OR-rule + `Crontab` parser),
      unit-tested; `editor/CrontabPreview` renders into the shared self-scrolling tree host; snapshot
      Export-to-PDF/Print for free. On by default; `Settings.crontabPreview` (schema 65→66). No new
      dependency. *Deferred: seconds/year 6-field cron, `L`/`W`/`#` (Quartz) modifiers, a 24h×7d heat-grid
      view, timezone-aware next-run display.*
- [x] XML tree preview — `.xml` joins the structured-data preview with a collapsible DOM tree (tags +
      attributes + text, text-only elements inlined). A *faithful* DOM model, not an XML→JSON shoehorn.
      Parsed off-thread with the JDK DOM parser (no new dependency), XXE-hardened like `PomParser`. New pure
      `structured/XmlNode`/`XmlParser` (unit-tested, incl. XXE-blocked) + `editor/XmlTree`; reuses the
      structured host + the same `Settings.structuredPreview` toggle. `.svg` still renders as an image
      (excluded); `.xhtml` still uses the browser preview. *Deferred: dialect renderers (RSS/Atom feed view,
      like OpenAPI for JSON), attribute/text search. Third of the reuse-existing-deps cluster (SVG, PDF, XML
      done; next: Excel/ODS via POI, font specimen, archive contents).*
- [x] PDF viewer — `.pdf` files open in a read-only page viewer (PDFBox-rasterized, already a dependency)
      instead of the hex viewer: ◀/▶ page nav + zoom (fit/actual/Ctrl+wheel). Pages rasterized one at a time
      off the FX thread on a single daemon thread (PDDocument isn't thread-safe), so only the current page's
      texture is held. New `ui/PdfViewerPane implements TabContent` (mirrors `ImageViewerPane`); routed in
      `openPath` before the hex fallback + round-tripped through session restore/`tabPath`. Local + remote
      (SFTP); 128 MB cap. No new dependency. *Deferred: continuous page scroll, page-jump field, text
      selection/search, password-protected PDFs. Second of the reuse-existing-deps preview cluster (SVG done;
      next: Excel/ODS via POI, XML tree, font specimen, archive contents).*
- [x] SVG image preview — `.svg` files stay editable XML (highlighting + LSP) but gain a rendered-image
      preview in the 3-mode view; edit source → re-render live. Rasterized off-thread via the already-bundled
      JSVG (`PreviewImageLoader.rasterizeSvg`, no new dependency), cached by source hash, zoom re-fits. New
      `editor/SvgImages` (mirrors `MermaidImages`/`DiagramImages` but in-process) + `EditorBuffer.isSvg()`/
      `hasSvgPreview()` + a `scheduleRenderPreview()` branch. On by default; `Settings.svgPreview` (schema
      64→65). *Deferred: export-as-PNG from the preview, checkerboard backdrop for transparent SVGs. First
      of the "reuse-existing-deps" preview cluster — see PDF/Excel/XML-tree/font/archive next.*
- [x] Structured-data preview (JSON/YAML/TOML tree + OpenAPI/Swagger docs) — `.json`/`.yaml`/`.toml` files
      get the 3-mode preview (like Markdown): a collapsible, type-colored data tree rendered off-thread; a
      JSON/YAML doc detected as an OpenAPI 3 / Swagger 2 spec renders as browsable API docs instead
      (endpoints + method badges + params/responses + schemas), with a tree ⇄ docs toggle
      (`structured.toggleView`). New pure `com.editora.structured`
      (`StructuredNode`/`StructuredParser`/`OpenApiModel`/`OpenApiParser`, all Jackson-contained,
      unit-tested) + `editor/StructuredTree`/`OpenApiDoc` (self-scrolling, hosted the CSV-grid way so the
      `TreeView` keeps virtualization). Render-branch model (no coordinator, like Markwhen); 50k-node cap.
      On by default; `Settings.structuredPreview` (schema 63→64). Adds jackson-dataformat-yaml + snakeyaml
      2.4 (both real JPMS modules, no moditect). *Deferred: GeoJSON map (offline vector plot),
      jump-from-tree-to-source, per-file view persistence, expand/collapse-all, editing.*
- [x] Diagram-as-code preview (Graphviz DOT + PlantUML) — `.dot`/`.gv` and `.puml`/`.plantuml` files get
      the same 3-mode preview as Markdown/Mermaid, rendered off-thread via the external `dot`/`plantuml`
      CLIs (both PNG-native, no headless browser) and cached by source hash; zoom resizes the image and a
      diagram exports to SVG/PNG/PDF. New generic, Mermaid-independent seam: pure `com.editora.diagram`
      (`DiagramKind`/`DiagramRenderer`/`DiagramService`) + `editor/DiagramImages` (async cache mirroring
      `MermaidImages`) + `ui/DiagramCoordinator`. Authored `dot`/`plantuml` TextMate grammars +
      `LanguageRegistry`/`GrammarRegistry`/`Commenter`/`FoldRegions` entries. On by default, self-gating on
      detection; `Settings.diagramSupport`/`dotPath`/`plantumlPath` (schema 62→63). *Deferred: PlantUML
      `@start/@end` folding, a themed (dark) render, live linting, and the browser-raster tools (D2,
      WaveDrom) — next up in the diagram-as-code section.*
- [x] Typst document preview — standalone `.typ` files get the same 3-mode preview as Markdown, rendered
      off-thread via the external `typst` CLI as a **multi-page** stack (one image per page). Its own seam
      (not a `DiagramKind`, since a document paginates): `com.editora.typst`
      (`TypstRenderer`/`TypstService`) + `editor/TypstImages` (async page-list cache with retain-last-image
      so live editing doesn't flicker) + `ui/TypstCoordinator`. Compiled with `--root` = the file's folder
      so relative `#image`/`#import` resolve. Native PDF export + PNG/SVG + paginated print. Authored
      `source.typst` grammar + `LanguageRegistry`/`GrammarRegistry`/`Commenter`/`FoldRegions`/`FileIcons`
      entries. On by default, self-gating on detection; `Settings.typstSupport`/`typstPath` (schema 66→67).
      **Editing parity with Markdown:** Enter list continuation (`-`/`+`/`N.`) + empty-marker exit/backspace,
      the floating selection format bar (bold `*`/emph `_`/raw `` ` ``/link/bullet/heading), right-click
      Format items, and `typst.*` palette commands — via the pure `com.editora.typst.TypstMarkup` (headings
      `=`, `#link("url")[…]`, list markers excluding `*`), reusing the shared inline-wrap/bullet cores.
      Preview is gated `!hugeFile` and caps the stacked pages at 40 (a "… N more pages" note; export/print
      use all). **Multi-file projects resolve:** the throwaway input is written in the file's own folder (so
      relative `#image`/`#import` resolve as on disk) and `--root` is the nearest `typst.toml` ancestor, else
      the active Editora project root when the file is inside it, else the file's folder (`RootResolver`, the
      LSP idiom; injected via `EditorBuffer.setTypstRootResolver` + `TypstCoordinator`) — so a doc deep in a
      project can `#import "/template.typ"` above its folder. Local files only — a remote/SFTP doc falls back
      to an isolated temp root, so a self-contained one still renders. **Inherent typst constraints
      (documented, not bugs):** `@preview` packages need a network fetch (offline → the doc errors in the
      preview); refs that escape the resolved root are blocked by typst's sandbox; an untitled buffer can't
      resolve any relative ref; uninstalled fonts fall back. **Editor conveniences shipped:** bundled
      snippets, `#table` insert (grid picker), `#outline()`/TOC insert, image paste/drop/drag → `assets/` +
      `#image("…")`, and preview → PNG/SVG export (native `typst -f`). **In-app typst-CLI installer shipped:**
      Settings → Typst **Install…** (+ `install.typstCli`) downloads the typst binary from GitHub releases
      (added `.tar.xz` extraction via `tar -xf`; archive id `typst-cli` distinct from the tinymist server's
      `typst`), applies it to `Settings.typstPath`, and re-detects — end-to-end verified against typst 0.15.
      *Deferred: a ppi/quality setting; **click-in-preview → jump-to-source** (infeasible on the raster
      preview — needs tinymist's websocket preview protocol + a `javafx.web` host Editora doesn't ship); and
      the generic "CLI → paginated image" seam (gnuplot, asciidoc-via-PDF).*
- [x] Typst language server (tinymist) — the 22nd LSP server: completion, hover, go-to-definition,
      find-references, document-symbol outline, push diagnostics (Problems window + squiggles), and Format
      Document for `.typ` files, complementing the rendered preview. One `ServerDef` in `LspServerRegistry`
      (`tinymist lsp`, root markers `typst.toml`/`.git`) + the served `typst` language id + a Settings
      enable/command pair (data-driven LSP page) + an install-catalog binary archive entry (tinymist GitHub
      releases) so Settings → LSP + the editor banner offer a one-click install. Live-verified: `tinymist lsp`
      answers `initialize` advertising completion/hover/definition/references/symbols/formatting/semantic
      tokens (tinymist 0.15.2). `Settings.typstLspEnabled`/`typstLspCommand` (schema 72→73). Supersedes the
      Typst preview's deferred "live linting / autocomplete". *Deferred: bundled `snippets/typst.json`.*
- [x] CSV/TSV grid preview moved into the editor as an IntelliJ-style Editor/Split/Preview view (mirroring
      the Markdown preview), replacing the bottom `csvGrid` tool window. The floating top-right toggle drives
      Editor (source), Split (source + live grid), and Preview (grid only); the mode is remembered per file.
      The grid keeps everything — header-row toggle, type profiler, sort/filter, ragged-row diagnostics,
      in-cell editing, click-to-jump, and PDF/Excel/ODS/print exports. Reuses `EditorBuffer`'s existing
      `MarkdownViewMode` machinery (a CSV buffer now reports `hasPreview()` once its grid is injected via
      `setCsvPreviewNode`); one `CsvGridPanel` per buffer; the `tool.csvGrid` command was retired.
      *Deferred: editor↔grid scroll-sync in Split (the grid scrolls independently; click-to-jump bridges it).*
- [x] Maven support — a toolbar icon (shown only when a pom.xml is detected for the active file/project)
      opens an IntelliJ-style actions popup: the standard lifecycle phases, the pom's declared profiles
      (checkable, composing with a run via `-P<id>`, marking any `activeByDefault` one), and each declared
      plugin's explicitly-bound `<executions>` goals as `<prefix>:<goal>` rows via Maven's own plugin-prefix
      convention — plus a "Run custom goal(s)…" freeform prompt. New pure `com.editora.maven` package
      (`PomModel`/`PomParser`/`MavenPluginPrefix`/`MavenLifecycle`/`MavenExecutable`/`MavenArgs`) parses
      pom.xml directly with the JDK's own XXE-hardened DOM parser (no new dependency, no
      `mvn help:effective-pom` shell-out); profile-scoped plugins nest under their own profile once
      checked. `MavenService` mirrors `RunService`'s streaming shape; runs prefer the project's `./mvnw`
      wrapper, falling back to `mvn` on PATH (or a Settings override), streaming to a default-hidden Maven
      console tool window. `Settings.mavenSupport` (default on, schema 61→62) + Simple-Mode/remote gating;
      also adds `OverlayHost.showBelow(...)` (mirroring `positionAbove`) for anchoring a popup below a
      top-of-window toolbar button. *Deferred: full effective-pom resolution (default-lifecycle bindings,
      parent inheritance, `<pluginManagement>`), a persistent run-configuration list.*
- [x] Build-tool framework + npm — generalized the Maven integration into one tool-agnostic
      `com.editora.build` framework (`BuildTool` enum, `BuildActionsProvider`/`BuildAction` model,
      `BuildService`, `BuildExecutable`, `OutputStyle`) driving a reusable `ui/BuildCoordinator` (one instance
      per tool: its own toolbar button, actions popup, streaming console, and `<tool>.*` commands). Maven was
      refactored onto it with no behavior change (the pure `maven/PomParser`/`PomModel`/… stay), and **npm**
      was added: a toolbar icon (shown only when a `package.json` is detected) whose popup lists every
      `scripts` entry (run portably as `<pm> run <name>`) plus common tasks (`install`; `ci` for npm), using
      the package manager detected from the `packageManager` field or the lockfile (npm/yarn/pnpm/bun). Pure
      `NpmProject`/`NpmPackageManager`/`NpmActionsProvider` parse `package.json` with the existing Jackson
      (no new dependency, no `module-info` change). `Settings.npmSupport`/`npmCommand` (default on, schema
      65→66); the Settings → Languages & Tools → **Build Tools** page is data-driven (one section per tool);
      palette gating is generic (per-tool ids). Adding the next tool (Cargo/Go/Gradle) is a new `BuildTool`
      constant + provider + icon + Settings fields + i18n — no `MainController`/coordinator change.
      *Deferred: Cargo, Go, Gradle (each its own follow-up); clickable console links stay Maven/JVM-only.*
- [x] Cargo, Go, and Gradle build tools — three new `BuildTool` constants on the framework, no
      `MainController`/coordinator change. **Cargo** (`Cargo.toml` via `TomlMapper`): the standard subcommands
      (build/run/test/check/clean/doc/bench/update/clippy/fmt) + additive `run --bin X`/`run --example Y` from
      `[[bin]]`/`[[example]]` (a virtual `[workspace]` → static only) + a `--release` `Toggle`; runs `cargo`.
      **Go** (`go.mod`/`go.work`): static subcommands over the whole module (`build ./...`, `test ./...`, `vet`,
      `fmt`, `mod tidy`/`download`, `generate`, `clean`, `install`); the `go.mod` module line is the label;
      runs `go`. **Gradle** (`build.gradle[.kts]`/`settings.gradle[.kts]`): the DSL can't be statically parsed,
      so static common tasks (build/clean/test/assemble/check/jar/run/bootRun) + the framework's "Run custom…"
      + an on-demand **Load all tasks…** popup action that runs `gradle tasks --all` on a short-lived process
      (pure `GradleTasks.parse`) and repopulates the popup in place (a new `BuildActionsProvider.addLoadedTasks`
      hook + a non-closing secondary popup action + `BuildTool.taskLoadLabel()`/`loadTasks()`); prefers the
      project's `./gradlew` wrapper, else `gradle`. Pure `CargoProject`/`CargoActionsProvider`/`GoProject`/
      `GoActionsProvider`/`GradleTasks`/`GradleActionsProvider` (all unit-tested). `Settings.{cargo,go,gradle}
      Support/Command` (default on, schema 66→67→68→69, additive-identity); Icons vendored from Simple Icons
      (Rust/Go/Gradle, CC0). **No new dependency / `module-info` change** (Cargo rides the existing TOML mapper;
      Go/Gradle are static + a regex). *Deferred: a `--release`-only subset for Cargo (the global toggle can
      combine with `fmt`/`update`); a per-root cache for Gradle's loaded tasks; PlantUML-style block folding;
      clickable console links stay Maven/JVM-only.*
- [x] Clickable links in the Markdown preview — a rendered link shows a hand cursor and opens in the
      system default browser on click (previously inert). `MarkdownRenderer.renderDocument` gained an
      overload taking an optional click handler, threaded through the block/inline render chain
      alongside `baseDir`; only the live interactive preview wires one — print/PDF and the
      hover/completion-doc popups keep the no-handler path.
- [x] Auto Close Tags (VS Code parity) — typing the `>` completing an HTML/XML open tag inserts
      `</name>` after the caret. Pure/unit-tested `editops/TagAutoClose` (one forward pass over a
      bounded pre-caret window; quote state tracked only inside tags so apostrophes in text and
      `>`/`<` inside closed attribute strings can't derail it; skips closers, `/>`, doctype/comment/PI,
      HTML void elements). Wired into `EditorBuffer.applyAutoCloseTyped` so the live key filter and
      macro replay share it; `Settings.autoCloseTags` (default on, schema 51→52) + Settings → Editor
      checkbox + palette `view.toggleAutoCloseTags`.
      *Deferred: `</` closing-tag name completion, JSX/TSX.*
- [x] Auto Rename Tag (VS Code parity) — editing an HTML/XML tag name mirrors the rename onto the
      paired open/close tag, per keystroke. Pure/unit-tested `editops/TagRename`: the pre-edit (old)
      name is reconstructed by reverting the change, then the pair is found by same-name depth counting
      over a single forward lex — only old-name tags participate, so real-world HTML's unclosed
      optional-close tags (`<li>`/`<p>`/…) can't misalign the match (v1 paired positionally and any
      unclosed tag suppressed the mirror) — comments/CDATA/doctype/PI/quoted attrs/self-closing skipped,
      HTML void + raw-text elements handled; half-typed new tags never rename the wrong closer.
      Wired in `EditorBuffer` on the immediate `plainTextChanges` pulse (html/xml only, off in
      large/huge files, suppressed during undo/redo); `Settings.autoRenameTag` (default on, schema
      50→51) + Settings → Editor checkbox + palette `view.toggleAutoRenameTag`.
      *Deferred: JSX/TSX tags, surviving a fully-emptied tag name (retyping from `<>` loses the link),
      single-undo-step mirroring (the user edit + mirror are two undo entries).*
- [x] String manipulation commands (the JetBrains String-Manipulation plugin family, P1) — case-style
      conversions on the selection/identifier at the caret (camelCase/PascalCase/snake_case/
      SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE/kebab-case/dot.case + Cycle Case Style + Swap Case) and whole-line transforms
      on the selection/whole file (sort asc/desc — natural numeric order, case-insensitive — sort by
      length, reverse, shuffle, remove duplicate/empty lines, trim trailing whitespace). Each its own
      palette command; one filterable picker `Edit: String Manipulation…` (`C-c x`). Pure/unit-tested
      `editops/StringCase` + `editops/LineTransforms`; single undoable edit, result re-selected.
      *Deferred (P2/P3): escape/unescape (Java/JSON/XML/HTML) + URL/Base64/unicode-escape encode/decode +
      diacritics→ASCII, align-by-separator, keep/remove lines matching a pattern, increment numbers /
      sequences across multi-carets, multi-caret fan-out.*
- [x] Plain-text developer formats — syntax highlighting for unified diffs (`.diff`/`.patch`, green/red
      added/removed lines via new `.text.diff-*` semantic classes), Makefile (`Makefile`/`GNUmakefile`/`.mk`),
      justfile, Protocol Buffers (`.proto`), GraphQL (`.graphql`/`.gql`), and `.gitattributes`
      (+ `.git/info/attributes`); a dedicated Java `.properties` grammar (Unicode escapes, `:` separator,
      `\`-continuations) replaces the INI borrow. Proto/GraphQL fold + auto-indent as brace languages;
      comment toggling wired for all. Grammars vendored MIT from shiki tm-grammars (diff/make/proto/graphql/
      just); properties/gitattributes written in-house.
      *Deferred: LSP servers (buf / graphql-lsp), Makefile forced-tab indent for brand-new files (existing
      files detect tabs).*
- [x] "Open this .patch in the diff viewer" — a right-click "Open in Diff Viewer" item (shown only for a
      `.patch`/`.diff` file) parses the buffer's own unified-diff text and opens its first file-section as a
      read-only structured diff (side-by-side, word-level highlighting, prev/next-change nav) instead of just
      syntax-highlighted diff text. New pure/unit-tested `diff/PatchParser` (the reverse of `PatchWriter`)
      reconstructs each file's old/new line sequences — tolerant of a bare `diff -u` file, a git `diff --git`
      preamble, several files back to back, `/dev/null` add/delete sides, and a "\ No newline at end of file"
      marker — then feeds them straight back into the existing `DiffEngine` pipeline. Palette-only
      `diff.openPatchFile`; a multi-file patch shows a status note and just the first file (v1 scope).
- [x] Sample corpus for manual feature testing — a curated, feature-organized `samples/` folder (syntax per
      language, folding, indent, markdown, mermaid, todo, spell, search, editorconfig, http, log, diff,
      encodings) with a `README.md` manifest. `SamplesCorpusTest` guards manifest↔files sync + core-language
      coverage; large/perf inputs are generated by `java scripts/GenSamples.java` (git-ignored); a scoped
      `.gitattributes` preserves the encoding/EOL/conflict-marker bytes.
      *Deferred: a richer perf-generator, optional per-feature automated assertions beyond the manifest guard*
- [x] Server log viewer — `.log` files get level highlighting (ERROR/WARN/INFO/DEBUG/TRACE, inline +
      size-independent left-edge bar), **Follow tail** (`tail -f`, floating toggle, auto-scroll), **open-the-
      tail** for huge logs (read-only, last N MB), and **live level + regex filtering** (filter-as-you-type;
      regex with a literal-substring fallback; stack traces inherit their record's level). Detects
      Logback/Log4j/JUL/syslog/nginx/structured/zerolog + access-log status. Logs open in View mode. On by
      default (Settings → Editor → Logs; `View: Toggle Log Viewer`); palette `Log: Toggle Follow` /
      `Filter by Level` / `Filter by Pattern` / `Clear Filter` / `View as Log`.
      *Deferred: tailing remote (SFTP) logs, multi-file merged tail, a dedicated Logs tool window,
      timestamp-range filtering, jump-to-next-error navigation*
- [x] Markdown support improvements — preview **CommonMark extensions** (YAML front matter, footnotes,
      heading anchors, `++inserted++`); **heading outline** in the Structure tool window; **Markdown lint**
      (squiggles + tool window; `View: Toggle Markdown Lint`, on by default — now a wider markdownlint rule
      set with per-rule config, inline `markdownlint-disable` comments, `.markdownlint.json` discovery,
      scrollbar/minimap overview stripes, and `Markdown Lint: Fix Issues` auto-fix); **image paste & drag-drop**
      (into a sibling `assets/` folder); **smart link paste** (URL over a selection → `[sel](url)`); **table
      cell navigation** (Tab/Shift-Tab between cells, Enter adds a row, reflow); **LaTeX math** via
      JLaTeXMath (inline `$…$` + display `$$…$$` in the preview and PDF, off by default — `View: Toggle Math
      Rendering`); and **Export to HTML** (`Preview: Export to HTML`, standalone self-contained file).
      *Deferred: inline-math in PDF/print, live Mermaid in exported HTML, full base64 image embedding in HTML*
- [x] TODO / highlight patterns (IntelliJ-style) — configurable regex patterns (TODO + FIXME by default,
      each with a color) highlighted wherever they match in the editor, and listed in a **TODO** tool
      window (`M-g o`) grouped by file (scans the open project's tree, else the open files; double-click to
      jump). On by default; add/edit/remove patterns in Settings → Editor → TODO Highlighting; commands
      `tool.todo` / `todo.refresh` / `todo.addPattern` / `view.toggleTodoHighlight`
- [x] Global indent-style preference — Settings → Editor → "Indent style" + **Editor: Set Indent Style…**
      palette command: force Spaces or Tabs for Tab/Enter, or keep Detect (per-file auto-detection).
      A file's `.editorconfig` `indent_style` wins; the global pref is the fallback above per-file detect
- [x] EditorConfig (`.editorconfig`) — resolves the nearest config chain (nearest-dir-wins, up to `root`)
      and applies indent style/size + `tab_width`, `end_of_line`, `charset` (utf-8/utf-8-bom/latin1/
      utf-16le/be, round-tripped on read & save), `max_line_length` (column ruler), and on-save
      `trim_trailing_whitespace` / `insert_final_newline`. Glob sections (`*` `**` `?` `[seq]` `{a,b}`
      `{n1..n2}`). On by default; Settings → Editor + **View: Toggle EditorConfig**. Local files only
- [x] AI inline completion — ghost-text continuations at the caret after a ~600 ms pause (Tab accepts),
      riding the existing prose-ghost presentation; windowed prefix/suffix prompt, stop-at-newline,
      128-token cap, generation-guarded (typing supersedes the in-flight request); its own fast model
      (default `claude-haiku-4-5`). Off by default under Settings → AI Actions. *(Next: multi-line
      ghost rendering, accept-word-by-word, per-language enable list.)*
- [x] AI connection status — a live green/red health check on Settings → AI Actions (and palette
      AI: Test Connection): a tiny one-token ping to the configured provider/endpoint/key/model,
      re-checked on page-open and debounced on edits. Surfaces a wrong endpoint / bad key / unknown
      model immediately. Mirrors the Git/Mermaid/LSP found-not-found status idiom.
- [x] Local LLM support (LM Studio / Ollama / vLLM) — an OpenAI-compatible provider for every AI feature
      (actions + inline completion): AiProvider enum + OpenAiSse reader (data-only SSE, `[DONE]`,
      `choices[].delta.content`, `finish_reason`→Anthropic stops), provider-aware AiClient headers/body,
      Settings.aiProvider/aiEndpoint (default LM Studio localhost, no key). Palette AI: Set Provider /
      Set Endpoint. *(Next: base/FIM completion models, per-request timeout tuning, model-list picker.)*
- [x] AI actions (direct Anthropic API) — streamed one-shot features over `java.net.http` (no SDK, no new
      dependency): commit-message generation from the staged diff (into the Commit window), explain
      selection (into a Markdown buffer), rewrite selection per instruction (one undoable edit, aborts if
      the buffer changed). Off by default (Settings → AI Actions); model + API-key settings with palette
      parity. *(Next: inline ghost-text completion (Tier 4), diff-preview for rewrites, keychain key
      storage, token/cost readout.)*
- [x] Embedded AI agent (ACP) — an Agent Client Protocol client (newline-delimited JSON-RPC over stdio)
      driving a user-installed agent (default: Claude Code via `claude-code-acp`) in an **AI Agent** chat
      tool window; fs reads serve open buffers' live text, fs writes apply as undoable buffer edits,
      permission requests pop a dialog. Off by default (Settings → AI Agent). No new dependency.
      *(Next: rich transcript (markdown/tool-call cards), diff-preview for edits, session persistence,
      agent-side MCP server pass-through, multiple sessions.)*
- [x] MCP server — a minimal Model Context Protocol server (loopback HTTP + bearer-token auth) embedded in
      the editor, exposing live state + the command registry to an LLM agent (twelve tools, incl. undoable
      buffer edits + save + open/navigate + symbols + git status); off by default
      behind a security notice (Settings → MCP Server). No new dependency
- [x] Local file history — IntelliJ-style snapshots of local files on save / auto-save / before an
      external reload, independent of any VCS; a **File History** tool window (`M-g l`) lists revisions
      (date/time, reason, size; latest tagged *Current*), double-click for a read-only diff vs current,
      restore = undoable whole-file replace. Gzip'd content-addressed blobs under `<configDir>/history/`,
      deduped, configurable retention. On by default; local-only; off in Simple UI
- [x] Emacs fill commands — Fill Paragraph (`M-q`), Fill Region, Set Fill Column (`C-x f`): re-wrap to a
      fill column, preserving indentation + an adaptive fill prefix (line comments, `>` quotes, Javadoc `*`)
- [x] LSP Format Document — whole-file reformat via the language server (palette + editor right-click),
      undoable, when the server advertises formatting
- [x] File-type icons — per-type glyphs everywhere a file is listed (tabs, Project tree, pickers, Switcher,
      finders); plus a "Current Folder" Project explorer when no project is open
- [x] Plugin support + a signed plugin registry — extend Editora via a Java SPI or a declarative
      `plugin.json` (commands, keybindings, tool windows, editor menu items, status-bar segments;
      snippets/templates). Off by default, full-trust, loaded via a child `URLClassLoader` so the same jar
      works in dev and the packaged installers. **Browse & install** from a curated GitHub registry or a
      local `.zip`; **19 plugins published** (text/encode/hash/json-xml/slug/box, UUID-timestamp inserters,
      markdown-TOC, formatter, open-on-GitHub, reveal/terminal, scratchpad, regex-tester, color-picker,
      word-count, calculator, task-runner, lorem-ipsum). **Security:** the index is verified against a
      bundled Ed25519 signature (*Require signed plugins*, default on), downloads are SHA-256-verified over
      HTTPS with bounded reads, and a capability-disclosure confirm is shown before enabling. See
      `docs/plugins.md`
- [x] Git history, blame & stash (IntelliJ/VSCode parity) — a **Git Log** tool window (`M-g h` / *Show File
      History*): browse commits, see a commit's files, double-click for a read-only diff, right-click to
      Copy Hash / Checkout / Reset / Revert / Cherry-Pick / New Branch. **Inline blame** (`M-g a`,
      GitLens-style "author, time ago • summary" on the current line; off by default). **Stash**
      push/pop/apply/drop (palette + branch dropdown). All Git-gated (off in Simple UI mode)
- [x] Simple UI mode — a one-toggle minimal layout (toolbar icon, **View: Toggle Simple UI Mode**,
      Settings → Application, or `--simple`): hides the extra toolbar groups (new-from-template, recent,
      find-in-files, split, project selector), the tool-window stripe, breadcrumb, the entire gutter
      (collapsed regions unfolded first), minimap, and most status-bar segments — keeping tabs, the core
      toolbar icons (incl. **Open**), and echo/read-only/zoom/Ln-Col/file-size. Also disables the heavier features
      (LSP, debugging, HTTP client, Git, multiple cursors / column selection). Persisted; `--simple` is a
      session-only override; saved preferences are untouched and restored on exit
- [x] Remote file access (SFTP) — connect over SSH/SFTP and edit a server's files as if local: the remote
      folder mounts in the Project tool window, open/edit/save go straight over SFTP, saved connections
      (metadata only) reconnect via a picker, a Remote Sites tool window (M-g r), a Settings → Remote
      management page, or a Welcome-page quick-connect list; local-process features (LSP/DAP/Git/Run/HTTP)
      auto-disable for remote files. Off by default; built on Apache MINA SSHD (Remote: Connect / Saved
      Connections / Manage Remote Sites / Open File / Disconnect)
- [x] HTTP Client (`.http`/`.rest` files) — a green ▶ on every request runs it with the built-in JDK
      HTTP client; response (status/headers/pretty-JSON/timing) in an HTTP Client tool window (`M-0`) with a
      highlighted viewer, history, Copy/Import as cURL. Near IntelliJ parity: `{{var}}`/`@var` + dynamic vars
      (`$random`/`$datetime` with date math/`$dotenv`), request chaining, multipart + external-file bodies,
      environment files (`http-client.env.json` + `$shared`), Basic/Digest auth, auto URL-encoding,
      response-to-file, per-request directives, run-whole-file
- [x] HTML Live Preview — a floating browser icon on `.html`/`.htm`/`.xhtml` files opens them in a detected
      browser (Safari/Chrome/Firefox/Edge/system default) served over a loopback JDK `HttpServer`, with
      live-as-you-type reload (assets load from disk; the page from the live buffer text); off by default
      (Settings → HTML Preview); `htmlPreview.open` / `htmlPreview.openIn` / `view.toggleHtmlPreview`
- [x] File templates — "New File From Template" (`C-c C-n`): single- or multi-file templates with a
      `${var}` wizard and `$0`/`${cursor}` placeholders; bundled (Java class, HTML page/bundle, Markdown,
      Python) + user templates in `~/.editora/templates/`
- [x] Debugging (DAP) — full debugger for **Java** (java-debug over jdtls), **Python** (debugpy), and
      **JavaScript/Node** (vscode-js-debug): breakpoints (conditional/logpoints), step/resume/pause/
      run-to-cursor/jump-to-line, call stack + variables + watches + set-value, inline values + hover, an
      IntelliJ-style Debug tool window (`M-g d`); off by default
- [x] Diff viewer & merge — side-by-side / unified diff (vs HEAD, a commit, or another file) with
      word-level highlights, prev/next nav, apply-hunk / apply-all (undoable), live refresh, patch export;
      a merge-conflict resolver (accept ours/theirs/both)
- [x] Multiple cursors & column/box selection — VS Code–style multi-caret editing (add caret at next
      occurrence / above / below) + Alt-drag column selection, via the personal RichTextFX fork
- [x] LSP support — **21 language servers** auto-detected on PATH (per-server Settings command + enable,
      off by default): Java (JDT LS), TypeScript/JavaScript, Python (Pyright), XML (lemminx), JSON,
      Bash/Shell, YAML, Go (gopls), Rust (rust-analyzer), PHP (phpactor), Ruby (ruby-lsp), C/C++ (clangd),
      C# (csharp-ls), HTML, CSS, Kotlin, Lua, Dockerfile, SQL (sqls), Terraform (terraform-ls), TOML (taplo) —
      diagnostics + Problems window (`M-8`) + minimap/scrollbar stripes, go-to-definition (`M-.`),
      find references (`M-?`), hover (`C-c h`), LSP completion, and TS/PHP auto-imports
- [x] Markdown editing — IntelliJ-style floating format bar on selection (bold/italic/strikethrough/code/
      link/list + Normal–H1…H6), `C-c`-prefixed shortcuts + right-click Format menu; smart list/blockquote
      continuation on Enter, heading promote/demote, link helpers (Ctrl/Cmd-click to open), GFM table reflow
      + cell navigation (Tab/Shift-Tab, Enter adds a row), image paste/drag-drop, and smart link paste
- [x] Run a file from a gutter ▶ — Java 25 compact source (`java <file>`), Python (`python3`), and shell
      (`bash`, when the Bash LSP is enabled); streams output into a Run tool window (`M-9`); gated by LSP
- [x] Print — native printing of code or the Markdown preview with a print-preview window (always light),
      reusing the PDF layout core (Settings → Editor → Export & Print); `editor.print` / `preview.print`
- [x] Export to PDF — code (searchable, embedded font, syntax highlighting + optional line numbers,
      always light theme), Markdown (native vector text), and standalone Mermaid `.mmd` (via mmdc);
      `editor.exportPdf` / `preview.exportPdf`; Settings → Editor (line numbers / highlighting / page size)
- [x] Mermaid diagrams — `.mmd` files + ` ```mermaid ` blocks in the preview (mmdc), export to SVG/PNG/PDF,
      live `maid` linting (squiggles), keyword + snippet autocomplete (Settings → Mermaid, off by default)
- [x] Welcome page — VSCode-style editor-area empty state (New File / Open File / recent) shown when no
      files are open, replacing the empty Untitled buffer; `--new-file[=name]` bypass
- [x] UI localization (i18n) — interface translated to English, Italian, Spanish, French, Portuguese,
      German; language picker in Settings → Appearance (applies on restart); key-parity test
- [x] Settings window redesign — sidebar categories, search, live preview, Reset to Defaults; Tool
      Windows + About moved out
- [x] Git support — native CLI: status-bar branch + ahead/behind, gutter change bars vs HEAD, Git tool
      window (stage/unstage/discard/commit), and fetch/pull/push + branch switch/create commands
- [x] Personal Notes — file-attached annotations (word/line/range/file scope, body/tags/status),
      content-hash + path identity (survive rename/move), gutter + highlight + hover indicators,
      tool window (`M-5`), `M-g n` jump, JSON export, per-project `notes.json`
- [x] Bookmarks — per-project, gutter markers + notes, tool window (filter, reorder via Alt+Up/Down /
      menu / drag-and-drop), `M-g b` cross-file jump picker, stored in `bookmarks.json`
- [x] Markdown preview — IntelliJ-style Editor / Split / Preview, live + off-thread, Ctrl+wheel zoom
- [x] Read-only / View mode (`C-x C-q`) — with "View Mode" banner and Space/Backspace paging
- [x] Projects — single-folder workspaces, per-project session + bookmarks
- [x] Switcher — open-files popup in tab order
- [x] Tool windows (Project, Structure, Bookmarks, File Information) + focused-window highlight
- [x] Zen mode + floating "Z" exit button
- [x] Navigation key hints in the Command Palette, Jump-to pickers, and file finder
- [x] Recent files, editor themes, text zoom
- [x] Snippets — VS Code/TextMate syntax, bundled for all 21 languages + user overrides
- [x] `--dev` mode (isolated `~/.editora-dev`), `--config-dir` / `EDITORA_CONFIG_DIR`, CLI file/project/zen args

## Editing
- [x] Smart backspace — clear the indent in one press / jump back on a blank auto-indented line
- [x] Auto indent
- [x] Smart indentation
- [x] Language indentation aware for the 21 languages we support
- [x] Autoclose `()[]{}` and quotes
- [x] Highlight matching braces
- [x] Comment/uncomment code region
- [x] Fill paragraph/region (Emacs `M-q` / Fill Region / `C-x f` set fill column) — re-wrap to a fill
      column, preserving indentation + an adaptive fill prefix (line comments, `>` quotes, Javadoc `*`)
- [x] Smart line start (`C-a`) — first press to the first non-whitespace, second toggles to column 0
- [x] Markdown formatting — format bar + smart list/heading/link/table editing (see "Recently shipped")
- [x] Format document — **LSP: Format Document** reformats the whole file via the language server
      (`textDocument/formatting`, when it advertises formatting), undoable; palette + editor right-click.
      (GFM table reflow also exists.)
- [x] Column select support — column/block selection (overlay + column-aware edits)
- [x] Multiple cursors support — VS Code–style multi-caret (add at next occurrence / above / below) +
      Alt-drag column selection (personal RichTextFX fork); see "Recently shipped"
- [x] Advanced Undo/Redo support — word/line-level undo coalescing (boundary + idle breaks) **and** an
      Undo History tool window (`M-g u`: in-session checkpoints, jump-to-restore). *The undo tree (branch
      recovery) was deliberately not pursued — it would mean replacing RichTextFX's linear undo engine for a
      niche payoff; revisit if there's demand.*
- [x] Spell check support — Lucene Hunspell, red squiggles, suggestions, user dictionary, en_US/en_GB; bundled technical-terms dictionary (toggle in Settings)
- [x] Private comments/notes — see **Personal Notes** under "Recently shipped"

## Search
- [x] Incremental Search — find bar searches as you type (debounced), jumps to the nearest match
- [x] Regex search — regex + case-sensitive + whole-word toggles in the find bar
- [x] Multi-file search — Find in Files (`C-S-f`): project + open buffers, off-thread, with replace-in-files
- [x] Search results panel — Search Results tool window (`M-6`), grouped by file, Enter/double-click to jump
- [x] Find in Files extras — include/exclude globs, query history (editable combo), regex `$1` replace, ripgrep badge, bold file names, right-side default
- [x] Highlight all matches — every match highlighted live in the editor (current one accented)
- [x] AceJump support — `M-g j`: type a char, then a label, to jump the caret to any on-screen occurrence

## Code intelligence
- [x] Autocomplete support — code: snippet popup (Enter/Tab); prose: inline ghost text (Tab); auto +
      `C-M-i`/`M-/` trigger; Settings toggle. (Next: document-words, LSP, fuzzy matching.)
- [x] LSP support — **21 servers** (see "Recently shipped"): diagnostics + Problems window (`M-8`) +
      minimap/scrollbar stripes, go-to-definition (`M-.`), find references (`M-?`), hover (`C-c h`),
      LSP-backed completion, TS/PHP auto-imports, and **Format Document** (whole-file reformat).
      Server-centric registry, per-server Settings, off by default. Document symbols power the Structure
      tool window. (Next: format-on-save; rename, code actions, quick fixes.)
- [x] Fix structure for the 21 languages we support — the Structure tool window now builds from the
      language server's `textDocument/documentSymbol` (precise hierarchy, real kinds, per-kind icons,
      method signatures), with the fold-region/TextMate heuristic as the fallback for non-LSP files;
      sort (Position/Name/Kind) + kind filter, expanded by default
- [x] Multi language support — UI string translation (en/it/es/fr/pt/de); see "UI localization (i18n)"
      under "Recently shipped"

## Snippets
- [x] GUI for Snippet management — Settings → Snippets: a master-detail editor (language picker +
      per-language user-snippet list + name/trigger/description/body form), saving to
      `<configDir>/snippets/<lang>.json`. Palette `Snippets: Manage Snippets…` (`snippets.manage`)

## Files & version control
- [x] Git support — native CLI (branch/status, gutter change bars, commit workflow, fetch/pull/push)
- [x] Diff viewer + merge-conflict UI — side-by-side / unified diff (vs HEAD / commit / another file),
      word-level highlights, apply-hunk / apply-all, patch export, merge-conflict resolver
- [x] Local file history — IntelliJ-style snapshots on save / auto-save / before an external reload; a
      **File History** tool window (`M-g l`) lists revisions (date/time, reason, size; latest tagged
      *Current*), double-click for a read-only diff vs current, restore = undoable whole-file replace.
      Gzip'd content-addressed blobs + a per-project index under `<configDir>/history/`, deduped, with
      configurable retention (revisions/file, age, size/project). On by default; local-only; off in Simple UI
- [x] Detect external file changes — prompt to reload when a file changes on disk (focus-regain / tab switch)
- [x] Auto-reload modified files
- [x] Remote file editing support — SSH/SFTP: browse/open/edit/save remote files; saved connections
      (metadata only); local-process features auto-disable for remote (see "Recently shipped")
- [x] Log mode support

## Keybindings
- [x] Complete emacs movement/text manipulation keybindings — backward-kill-word (`M-DEL`),
      upcase/downcase/capitalize-word + region (`M-u`/`M-l`/`M-c`, `C-x C-u`/`C-x C-l`), join-line (`M-^`),
      delete-horizontal-space (`M-\`), just-one-space (`M-SPC`), delete-blank-lines (`C-x C-o`),
      open-line (`C-o`), kill-whole-line (`C-S-DEL`), zap-to-char (`M-z`), forward/backward-sexp +
      mark/kill-sexp (`C-M-f`/`C-M-b`/`C-M-SPC`/`C-M-k`), beginning/end-of-defun (`C-M-a`/`C-M-e`),
      mark-paragraph (`M-h`), mark-whole-buffer (`C-x h`), move-to-window-line (`M-r`).
- [x] Mark ring — `C-SPC` pushes the caret onto a per-buffer ring (bounded 16, edit-tracked), `C-x C-SPC`
      (`edit.popMark`) pops back and cycles. Pure `editops/MarkRing`. *Explicit marks only — automatic
      jump-back is the separate NavigationHistory; no C-u prefix, so pop is its own command; session-only;
      no global (cross-buffer) mark ring.*
- [x] Query-replace — interactive `M-%` / `C-M-%` (regexp): per-match `y`/`n`/`!`/`.`/`q` loop, regex
      group expansion, case-insensitive search. Pure `editor/QueryReplace` kernel + a modal session.
      *`,` (replace-and-pause), `^` (back to previous), region-restricted replace, and case preservation
      are deferred; the Emacs keymap's `M-%` was repurposed from the find bar's replace.*
- [x] Narrowing — `C-x n n`/`C-x n d`/`C-x n f`/`C-x n w`. True narrowing (the document text really is
      swapped), made safe by `EditorBuffer.getContent()` meaning the whole document so save/autosave/diff/
      history/find-in-files stay correct unchanged. *LSP suspended while narrowed; marker persistence
      suspended; undo history dropped at the boundary; narrowing is session-only and does not nest.*
- [x] Rectangles — the `C-x r` family: kill/copy/yank/delete/clear/open, string-rectangle and
      rectangle-number-lines, over the mark-based selection, each a single undo step and remembered
      separately from the kill ring. *Character columns, so tab-indented text does not line up with the
      display; rectangle registers deferred with registers generally.*
- [x] Kill ring — every kill command feeds a bounded ring; `C-y` yank, `M-y` yank-pop, consecutive-kill
      accumulation (forward appends, backward prepends), a palette picker over past kills, and system-clipboard
      bridging in both directions. *Per window and session-only; registers / rectangles / `C-u` prefix argument
      remain deferred.*
- [x] Fully configurable shortcuts — keybinding editor in Settings → Keymaps: searchable command list,
      multi-key chord recorder, conflict warnings, per-command + global reset; live (no restart), persisted
      as overrides on top of the active keymap theme
- [x] Keybinding themes — switchable in Settings → Keymaps / `keymap.select`, live (no restart), per-OS
      (Ctrl vs Cmd): **Emacs** (default), **CUA**, **Sublime Text**, **VSCode**, **IntelliJ IDEA**
- [ ] Vim keybindings (modal — needs a mode state machine: normal/insert/visual, operators, counts,
      registers, `:` command line; deferred as its own feature)
- [x] Standard accelerator commands — `edit.selectAll` / `edit.duplicateLine` / `edit.moveLineUp` /
      `edit.moveLineDown`, bound in the CUA/Sublime/VSCode/IntelliJ keymaps

## UI / UX
- [ ] UI final touches (fonts, colors, etc.)
- [x] Pretty up Settings Window — sidebar categories, search, live preview, reset
- [x] File-type icons — a per-type glyph (language logos, image/archive/PDF/table/…, generic fallback)
      everywhere a file is listed: tabs, Project tree, Open-Files/Recent pickers, Switcher, file/folder finders
- [x] "Current Folder" explorer — with no project open, the Project tool window roots at the active file's
      folder and follows the focused tab
- [x] Upgrade breadcrumbs support — _partial:_ Reveal in File Manager / Open Terminal Here on a crumb
- [x] Fix Zen mode
- [~] Font ligatures (Fira Code / JetBrains Mono `=>`, `!=`, …) — **not feasible on the current stack.**
      Programming ligatures are OpenType contextual alternates (`calt`), and JavaFX exposes no
      feature-control API (no `-fx-font-feature-settings`, no `Font` method) — it only auto-shapes
      complex scripts, never Latin programming ligatures. Even if it did, RichTextFX's editing model
      maps one char → one glyph cell for caret/selection/hit-testing, which ligature glyph-substitution
      breaks (the caret lands in the wrong column). Would require both JavaFX feature support *and*
      ligature-aware caret math in the fork. Deferred unless JavaFX adds OpenType feature control

## Extensibility & integration
- [x] Plugins/API support — Java SPI (`com.editora.plugin.Plugin`) + declarative `plugin.json`
  (keymap / external commands / snippet & template dirs); contributes commands, keybindings, tool windows,
  editor right-click items, and status-bar segments. The `ActiveEditor` facade does
  `filePath`/`text`/`selectedText`/`caretLine`/`replaceSelection`/`insertAtCaret`/`setText`/`openPath`, and
  `PluginContext` adds `openUrl`/`log`/`setStatus` + path accessors. Off by default (Settings → Plugins).
  Loaded via a child `URLClassLoader` so it works in the sealed jlink installers. **Registry + install:**
  browse a curated GitHub-hosted `index.json`, install (download + SHA-256 verify + zip-slip-guarded unzip)
  or install from a local `.zip`; per-plugin Remove. **19 plugins published** in the
  [adriandeleon/editora-plugins](https://github.com/adriandeleon/editora-plugins) registry (which also
  carries each plugin's source), with 18 worked examples under `examples/`. **Security:** the index is
  verified against a bundled **Ed25519 signature** (`Settings.pluginRequireSignature`, default on, blocks an
  unsigned/unverified registry; sign with `scripts/PluginSigningTool.java`); a **capability-disclosure
  confirm** (jar? external commands? keybinding remaps?) runs before enabling at every arming point; reads
  are size-bounded and a non-default registry host is flagged. See `docs/plugins.md`.
  *Deferred: sandboxing, hot reload, gutter-marker contributions, GitHub-API/per-repo discovery,
  per-plugin/TOFU signing, auto-update.*
- [x] External Tools support
- [x] MCP support — a minimal **Model Context Protocol** server embedded in the editor (loopback HTTP +
      bearer-token auth) so an LLM agent (Claude Code, …) can observe state, edit files, and drive the
      command registry. Twelve tools — reads `list_open_files` / `read_buffer` / `get_selection` /
      `get_diagnostics` / `document_symbols` / `git_status` / `find_in_files` / `list_commands`, writes
      `edit_buffer` (undoable str-replace / whole-buffer edits) / `save_buffer`, actions `open_file`
      (with line:col navigation) / `execute_command`; writes `<configDir>/mcp-endpoint.json` for discovery;
      status-bar indicator (click to copy the connection command). Off by default behind a security-notice
      dialog (Settings → MCP Server; `view.toggleMcp` / `mcp.copyEndpoint`). No new dependency
      (`jdk.httpserver`). (Next: resources/prompts, stdio transport, TODO-scan + open-tabs tools.)
